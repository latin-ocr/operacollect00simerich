interlineations, ‚ and, as regards the poetry, abounding with
alternative readingS, as if it had been taken from a still ruder
copy, which could not with certainty be deciphered.

That the rubric was an after-thought, is obvious from the
position which it occupies. No space remained for it at the
top of the page, which was already occupied by the appropriate
rubric of the Legend of the Martyrdom of the two Kentish
Princes, and it had to be written at the bottom of the previous
pagest Mr. Raine does not pronounce with certainty whether
the rubric is written by the same hand as the two chronicleS,
but the writing is of nearly the same period.

PART I.—A.D. 732-95 7.

As the entire history consists of two somewhat incongruous
parts, so the first part is composed of two divisions equally
distinct, written at different periods, but both far anterior to
the age of Symeon, whatever part he may possibly have taken
in rcducing them to their present form.

The first division, extending to the commencement of the
ninth century, has every appearance of having been written
contemporaneously with the events which it recordS. The
second is a paraphrase, somewhat abridged in detail, but much
more diffuse in language, of Asser's Life of Alfred, with a few

‘1 The work which immediately precedes the miscellaneous matter which is
grouped with the History of the Kings in the Cambridge MS. is the little tract
on the Siege of Durham‚ at the foot of which the rubric is written. Next before
this is the epistle to Dean Hugh on the archbishops of York, which is une-
quivocally Symeon's, and in the body of which his name occurs. It is difficult
to know what inference to draw from this: whether it induced the rubricist to
ascribe to Symeon the matter which follows, and which was previously anony-
mous, or whether the whole had been transcribed from a copy in the same
handwriting, or which could be traeed to have belonged to Symeon. The only
conclusion at which we can safely arrive is a negative one, that in discrediting
the authority of the rubric, we do not necessarily disprove Symeon's connection

with any of the works with which his name has been associated, but leave it to -

be decided on other evidence.
