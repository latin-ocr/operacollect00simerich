been already stated, with an abridged paraphrase of Asser's
Life of Alfred, which is continued from the Saxon Chronicle to
the end of his reign. The first entry refers to A.D. 802, forty-
seven years before Alfred’s birth, being a narrative of events at
that date, which are introduced by Asser in explanation of a
custom to which he has occasion to allude under A.D. 856.
These particulars are here inserted in chronological order imme-
diately before the last imperfect items belonging to the first
division. These items relate to the series of archbishops of
Canterbury and bishops of Lindisfarne, which form part of
the earlier work, and two similar entries are inserted in the
second part by a more recent hand at the bottom of the
page. With these exceptions, there are but four entries
between 802 and 887 which are not derived from Asser. Of
these, three, under the years 875, 877, and 883, are from
the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto, and two of them are inter-
lineations 3 the fourth, under the year 881, is from an un-
known source, which has also been made use of in the second
part, under the same date, and is unconnected with English
historyJ⁶

From the death of Alfred there is nothing like a continuous
narrative, but a series of unconnected notices extend over a
period of fifty-eight years ,- of these, about forty in all, more
than half are taken from the Saxon Chronicle ,- the others fur-
nish many particulars, chiefly in connection with Northumbrian
history, which cannot be traced to any earlier source.

The last entry under the year 957 records the death of
Edgar and the accession of Edwin, after whose reign of seven-
teen yearS, we are told, “reigned his son Edward, who was
slain by the treachery of his step-mother, and rests at Shaftes-

auferentes hac illacque discurrebant. The words in parentheses are only in the
notice in the second part. The locality indicated is Fleurie in Lyonnois, and the
particulars are probably from Abbo, who was an inmate of that monastery, and
whose Legend of the Passion of St. Edmund is referred to in the second part,
p. 70, l. 21.
