GENEALOGIA RE GUM NORTHANHYMBRORUM .

In exordio hujus operis genealogiam regum Cantuariorum
strictim praelibavimus 3 nunc Northanhymbrorum libet demon-
strare, ut ad eorum tempora valeamus pervenire, de quibus non
est narratum post obitum reverendissimi sacerdotis Bedaefl

g This paragraph refers to the preceding legend, which seems to have been
the model on which the style of the Northumbrian Genealogy was formed. This
latter piece is of no value as an original authority, being a mere paraphrase in
very bombastic language of the “Brief Northumbrian Chronology,” printed in
the Monumenta Historica‚ page 290, with a few additions Subsequent to the in-
troduction of Christianity from the Ecclesiastical History of Beda. 'Phe sequence
of the successors of Ida is the same in both lists3 and although there is some
discrepancy in the length os the several reigns, the summation of the whole is the
same in each. VVhere differences occur, the Northumbrian Chronology seems
the better authority, confirmed as it is by the genealogy appended to Nennius.
The following table will explain the variations.

Florence of Worcester has a distinct list, not only differing in the length and
sequence of the reigns, but introducing a new name, Theolwulf, and omitting
Hussa. Wallingford has framed a list from those several authorities, adopting the
order in which the names occur in Florence3 but taking the length of the reigns
from the Northumberland Chronology‚ and giving a place to Hussa instead of
Theolwulf. Hussa indeed is noticed with too great particularity‚ not merely in
the Genealogy, but in the narrative of Nennius, to allow of the omission of his
name3 whilst the general accuracy of the succession of the kings, as recorded by
Florence‚ is corroborated by the Saxon Chronicle3 which, although it omits two
others, expressly mentions Ethelric as the immediate predecessor of Ethelfrith.
As this is a matter of some interest in Northumbrian history, Ι subjoin the
series of Florence and the composite list of Wallingford.

Of these Adda, Ethelric, and Theodric, were sons of Ida ; and our three first
cited authorities seem to have misled us by placing them in the order of their
birth, rather than 'in that of their succession to the throne.
