seven enrolled previous to Symeon had been reduced by deaths

and removals during an interval of nine or ten years.
Assuming the date of his profession to have been about

A.D. 1083, we cannot place that of his birth much later than
A.D. 1060, and these dates are consistent with the fact related
by himself,9 and with greater particularity by an historian of
the succeeding century, Reginald of Coldingham,'² that he was
present at the exhumation of the remains of St. Cuthbert in
1104, and assisted at the solemnity, being at that period one
of the senior monks.

The others who officiated on this solemn occasion were
Turgot the Prior ,· Aldwine the Sub-prior, Leofwinc and
Wiking ,- Godwin and Osburn, the sacrists ,- Henry and William
the archdeacons 3 and Algar, afterwards Prior. Of these, seven
were of superior standing to Symeon, and two were his juniors.2'
Symeon was not as yet distinguished by any official designation,
but he seems afterwards to have attained the rank of precentor,
by which title he is described in the rubrics to his History of
the Kings of the Angles and Danes, and also in that prefixed
to the copy of his History of the Church of Durham‚ which is
preserved in the Cambridge University Library. · His obit was
celebrated on the 14th of October by his brethren and suc-
cessors in the Church of Durham,j but we have no information
as to the year of his deceases‘ His History of the Kings of
the Angles and Danes is brought down to the year 1129, and
his account of the archbishops of York must have been written
