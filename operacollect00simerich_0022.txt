cession of the archbishops and bishops of Canterbury and the
Northern sees ,- after which we have no indication of any farther
portion of these earlier materials, but the second division com-
mences after another interval of nineteen years.

It is not to be wondered at that Symeon's name has been
connected with this work, although we have shewn that the
original fabric at all events is of much earlier date. Not only
does he use it during a long period as the basis of the civil
history which is necessarily intermixed with his account of the
Church of Durham, but in many instances he adopts the pecu-
liarities of its language. The following instances of identity
of expression will be sufficient to shew that the coincidence is
not fortuitOUS, but that he must have written with the book
open before him 2—-

1. Describing the elevation of Egbert, bishop of York, to
the archiepiscopal dignity, A.D. 735, the following words are
used in the annals, and are adopted by Symeon : “ Primus post
Paulinum, accepto ab Apostolica sede pallio, genti Northanhym-
brorum in archiepiscopatum confirmatus est.’'⁸

2. Speaking of the death of Balther, the hermit of Tyning-
ham, the words in these annals are z ‘⁶ Viam sanctorum patrum
est secutus, migrando ad Eum, Qui se reformavit ad imaginem
Filii 8111.υ Symeon has the same words, with the substitution
only of “ingressus est '² for ‘⁶ est secutus.''t

3. In reference to the retirement of King Eadbert to the
cloister at York, we read here: “ In clericatu Deique Omni-
potentis servitio.” Symeon has the same words, transposing
“ Dei '' and “ Omnipotentis.'’²⁴

4. Under the year 793 Symeon copies with slight verbal
alterations, first a minute description of the island and monas-
tery of Lindisfarne3 secondly, an account of the prodigies
which preceded the destruction of the latter 3 and, lastly, the
particulars of the catastrophe. In this case, if we had had any
doubt as to which was the original authority, it would have
