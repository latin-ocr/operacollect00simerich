PREFACE. xxxvii

in which it was proposed to convey the body of the Saint to
Irelands‘ On one point there is a remarkable discrepancy
between the older authority and Symeon, which cannot be re-
garded as accidental. The former describes the removal of the
body of St. Cuthbert, as well as of king Ceolwulf, to Norham
from Lindisfarne by Bishop Ecgfrid ,J the latter mentions that
of Ceolwulf 01:11an The topographical information which we find
in the History of St. Cutlzbert is invaluable, notwithstanding
the obsolete, and in very many cases vitiated spelling, which
renders it difficult to recognize the local names. This difficulty
seems to have existed in the time of Symeon, who has not‘
always attempted to grapple with it. Great pains have been
taken to correct the text wherever it can be done with certainty z
conjectural emendations are suggested in the notes, where also
will be found the modern names and the localities of the places
mentioned.

This piece was printed by Twysden from a MS. in the public
Library of the University of Cambridge, where it is appended
to the History of the Clzurclz of Damam, in connection with
which the MS. will be described in the Preface to the second
volume. No other copy was then known to exist. A MS. in
the Library of Lincoln's Inn⁷2 is described by the late Mr. Hun-
ter in a report to the Record Commissioners⁰ as bearing a great
resemblance to it, but on examination such was not found to be
the case, the work in question being merely a biography of the
Saint, containing no information of novelty or importance.

Whilst this volume was passing through the press, Mr. Rainc
discovered a very ancient copy in the Bodleian Libraryss defective
at the commencement, but containing a continuation which
brings the history of the property of his church to the reign of
