PRE FAcE. xiii·

extensive extracts from this MS„ was fully alive to the inac-
curacy of the above description, and has modified the rubric,
first, by rejecting the false computation, and, secondly, by
discriminating between the Historia post Bedam, and the incon-
gruous medley of discordant materials which has been asso-
ciated with im The historical matter, to which alone the
rubric properly applies, consists of two separate compilationS,
perfectly distinct and unconnected, but which do between them
extend over the interval from the death of Beda to the latter
years of Henry I., the first part reaching from the termination
of the Ecclesiastical History, four years before the death of its
author, to the year 957, the second going back to the birth of
King Alfred, A.n. 848, and ending in the 30th of Henry I.,
A.D. 1129.

That the scribe of the Cambridge MS. himself, when he
copied the several pieccs which he has grouped together under
this rubric, did not regard them as portions of an integral
whole, is obvious on a reference to Mr. Raine's report. Nay,
further, he has not even treated the two chronicleS, which we
are content to accept as the first and second parts of the
His-lory of the Kinys, as if they were in any way connected.
The first, although written with some regard to neatness and
regularity, is totally void of ornament, whilst the second is
executed with considerable elegance, and adorned with an illu-
minated initial, which if it were to be found in one only of two
parts of the same work, we should at all events expect to find
at the commencement of the first and not of the second. The
prcliminary matter, again, is so carelessly transcribed as in
many places to be scarcely legible, replete with erasures and

Ρ The rubrio as modified by Leland is as follows :-Ex historia Symeonis
monachi, precentoris Dunholmensis ecclesiae, quam scripsit de regibus Anglorum
et Danorum a tempore Bedae usque ad ultimos annos Henrici Primi, regis Angliae 3
ita tamen ut ante praescriptam historiae inchoationem incipiat a genealogia regum
Cantianorum et vitam Ethelberti et Ethelredi martyrum, et filiorum Eormenredi,
qui fuit filius Eadbaldi‚ et frater Erconberti regum Cantiae, scribat et posterea
adsuat genealogiam regum Northanhynbrorum, multa interserens de abbatibus,

cum Weremutensis tum Gyrovieencis coenobii, ac etiam de Beda (Collectanea,
vol. ii„ p. 347: ed. 1774).
