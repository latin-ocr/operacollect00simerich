PREFACE. xxi

We have also several details of the history of Scotland
during the period of the Pictish predominance, which are either
altogether unnoticed elsewhere, or confined to the text before
us, and the kindred pages of the Northumberland Annals.

A.D. 744. A battle between the Picts and Britons.

A.D. 756. Eadbert, king of Northumberland, and Unust,
king of the Picts, led an army against the city of Alclyde, and
there received the submission of the Britons on the first day of
August. On the tenth of the same month almost the whole of
the army perished, on the route from Ouania to Newburgh.

A.D. 774. Alcred, king of Northumberland, fied with a few
companions first to Bamburgh, and afterwards to Cynoht, king
of the Pictsst

Not less important is the confirmation given to the accuracy
of the ancient Chromin-on Pictorum, by the dates which are here
furnished of the decease of Unust, or Ungus,a‘ and of Cynoht.
The Pictish Chronicle does not give the dates of the accession
or deaths of the several kings, but specifies the length of each
reign, so that the knowledge of the year of the death of one*
king enablesus to ascertain the dates of the whole series , pro-
vided we are 'assured of the accuracy of the statement of the
duration of the intermediate reignS. Now the Irish Annals
give the date of Cynoht’s death A.D. 775, and the Chronicle
furnishes the length of his reign twelve yearS, and of that of
his predecessor, Brude, the immediate successor of Ungus, two
years, thus fixing the death of Ungus, A.D. 761. Our Annals
not only agree with the Irish Annals in placing the death of
Cynoht AJ). 775, but confirm the accuracy of the intermediate
computation, by supplying the date of Ungus’s death also,
which the Irish Annals do not, in this very year 761.

The second division of the first part commences, as has

¹' In our Annals under the year 750, we read, Cuthred rex Occidentalium
Saxonum surrexit contra AEthilbaldum regem Merciorum3 the Northumberland
Annals add, ‘⁶ eb Oengusumf’

j Unust, Pictorum reX, defunctus est. 'Phe Northumberland Annals add,
‘⁶ qui regni sui principium usque ad finem facinore cruentum tyrannus carnifex
produxit.”
