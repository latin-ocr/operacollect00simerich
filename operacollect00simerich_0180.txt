Northymbrensium, quatinus statu regum Northanthymbrorum
deficiente, a quibus coeperit provincia illa amministrari Comi-
tibus agnoscatur. Ultimus regum provinciae illius fuit Eirieus
quem Northymbrenses, violata fide quam regi Eadredo jurave·
rant, sibi regem fecerunt. Quare offensus rex jussit ut tota
provincia funditus vastaretur. Illico NorthymbrenseS, expulso
rege suo atque occiso a Maccus filio Anlafi, juramentis et mune-
ribus placaverunt regem Eadredum, commissa provincia Osulfo
comitis Qui postea, regnante Eadgaro, socium accepit Oslacum.
Deinde Osulfus ad aquilonalem plagam Tinae, Oslac vero super

'² Wendover says that King Yric was slain on a certain waste called ‘⁶ Stein-
mor,'' with his son Henry and brother Reginald, “ a Macone consule,'' through
the treachery of Earl Osulf, and then King Eadred reigned in those parts (vol. i.‚
pp. 402-3). From the way in which he is mentioned as “Osulf comes,’' it is
probable that he was already in possession of the earldom of Bamburgh, or
Northumberland beyond the Tyne, by hereditary right, in succession to the
kings and dukes who had held the government from the period when the district
south of the Tyne was overrun by the Danes A.D. 867. At all events the
Northern earldom continued to descend in his family, whilst that of Yorkshire
was bestowed at pleasure by the kings of England3 and amongst his descendants
we find the recurrence of the same names which prevailed amongst his imme-
diate predecessors,-Eadulf‚ Aldred‚ and Uchtred, as also Usulf. ·

f ὃ sscctlirdidng to9glge Saxon Chronicle, Oslac, “the great earl‚'' was banished
rom n r an A.D. .
g ‘⁶ Oslac from this land
. O'er rolling waters,
Over the gannet's bath
Hoary-haired hero,
Wise and word-skilled,
Over the waters' throng,
O'er the whale's domain,

Of home bereaved.”
Mon. Hist„ p. 397.

⁶ Wendover calls him Eadulf. Under the same year 975 he says : ‘⁶ Bishop
Alfsy and Earl Eadulf conducted Kenneth, king of Scotland‚ to King Edgar,
who made him many presents of his royal bounty. He gave him, moreover, the
wholedistrict called Laudian (Lothian) in the native tongue, on this condition,
that every year, on certain festivals, when the king and his successors should
wear the crown, he should come to court, and celebrate the festival with the
other nobles. The king gave him besides many mansions on the road, that he
and his successors might find entertainment in going and returning 3 and these
houses continued to belong to the kings of Scotland till the time of Henry 11.”
(vol. i.‚ p. 416). This statement is scouted by Chalmers as resting on the testi-
mony of Matthew of Westminster (cited on one occasion by mistake as william
of Malmesbury)‚ but is at least worthy of consideration, when traced to the
respectable authority of Roger of Wendover. With WValtheof commences the
list of Northumbrian earls in Symeon’s little tract, De Obsessione Dunelmi,
which furnishes some of the vparticular-s which follow in the present text, with
much which has not been transferred to it. A comparison of the two authorities
surnishes a very complete history of the official earls of Northumberland, respect-
ing whom we have few particulars elsewhere.
