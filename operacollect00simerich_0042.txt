Symeon on two occasions as the “ancient cartulary of the
Church,”d in which are recorded grants and acquisitions, to
which he adverts in general terms, but omits the particulars,
which he says “ it is unnecessary to detail, as they are written
“ elsewhere.” It is, indeed, essentially a cartulary‚ although in
a narrative form, and was probably the only evidence which
remained of the original charters, which had perished amidst
the desolations of the ninth century, when the house of Lindis-
farne was twice burnt, its inmates driven forth, and their lands
devastat-ed. The only charter which occurs in diplomatic form
is of a period subsequent to the removal of the bishopric to
Chester-le-Street, and records the bounty of king Athelstan,⁶
the brother and predecessor of Edmund, to whose time the
narrative is ‘brought down, and which is no doubt truly
described as “ nunc temporis '' by the writer.

This tract is the earliest authority for the story of the
appearance of the Saint to king Alfred in a vision, in which he
promises him his protection, and assures him of the success of
his arms against the Danes.f The legend is copied and em-
bellished by Malmesbury,9 and is briefly told by Symeonst with
this qualification, that “since the particulars are elsewhere
“ fully detailed, it is not expedient to repeat them here.''

Symeon also adopts without acknowledgment the details of
the death of Halfdene, of the elevation of Guthred to the
throne of Northumberland, and the incidents of his reign ,i
also the ravages of Reinold, or Ragnal, and his lieutenants
Scula and Onalafball, between the Tees and Tyne, and the
punishment of the latterj

From the History of St. Cuthbert he has also culled the
miracle of the three bloody waveS, which drove back the bark
