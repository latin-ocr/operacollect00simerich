obsessione Dunelmi, in the present volumey is not the least
important. One list follows the series of kings of North-
umberland in the Libellus de Adventu Saoeonum, the other is
introduced, somewhat out of place, under the year 1072, in the
Historia Reyumst

In both Osulf is represented as the first earl of the two
provinces of Northumberland in the reign of Edred. In the
Historia Reyum we are told that, in the reign of Edgar, Oslac
was associated with him, to whom he resigned the province of
York, retaining only the district north of the Tyne. According
to the Libellus, Osulf was succeeded in due course by Oslac in
York, and by Eadulf Yvilcild in all the country from the Tees
to the Frith of Forth (Myreforth). “These two earIS,” it is
added, “with Elfsius, bishop os the see of St. Cuthbert, pre-
sented Kyneth, king of the Scots, to king Edgar, who, when
he had done homage,‚gave him Lothian, and dismissed him
with great honour.” We can scarcely suppose that Eadulf
Yvilcild is a fictitious character, introduced for the purpose of
playing a part in the transfer of Lothian to the Scotch, which
might with equal propriety have been assigned to Osulf or
Waltheofs Neither is there any reason to doubt the perfect

⁹ This is evidently not the place which the list originally occupied, as a
reference is made two years earlier, ΑΛ), 1070, to a statement contained in it
respecting earl Gospatric, ‘⁶ qui, ut supradictum est,'' etc. In Hoveden's Annals,
which are to a great extent a mere copy from the Historia Regum, it is placed
under ΑΛ). 953, which should undoubtedly have been its position in the latter
’ work, in which we find under the previous year, “ Defecerunt hic reges North-
anhymbrorum 3 et deinceps ipsa provincia administrata est per comites '³ (p. 66).

r Until the examination of the Libellus de Adventu samonum, the earliest
known authority for this account of the cession of Lothian was Roger of
Wendover, and as no mention of any earl Eadulf earlier than Eadulf Oudel
occurred in any list then known, it was assumed that Eadulf had been written
by mistake for Waltheof, senior, the father of earl Uchtred. See p. 90, note c,
and p. 212, note h. Wendover' s account, ag ain, gives further particulars which
are not elsewhere to be found. ·‘-—- ‘Bishop Alfsey and earl Eadulf conducted
