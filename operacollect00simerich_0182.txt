Qui inter tumultuari tes turbas lapsus dum lateret in ecclesia pro-
ditus, incendio ecclesiae compellitur usque ad ostium procedere,
ubi in ipso ostio manibus Osulfi detruncatur, quinta ebdomada

commissi comitatus 111] 1(1115 Martii. Mox sequenti autumno,
et ipse Osulfus, cum in obvii sibi latronis lanceam praeceps irru-
eret, illico confossus interiit. Quo mortuo, Cospatricus, filius
Maldredi filii Crinani, Willelmum regem adiens, multa emptum
pecunia adeptus est comitatum Northymbrensium! Nam ex
materno sanguine attinebat ad eum honor illius comitatus.
Erat enim ex matre Algitha, filia Uhtredi comitis, quam habuit
ex Algiva filia Agelredi regis. Hanc Algitham pater dedit in
conjugium Maldredo filio Crinani. Tenuit autem comitatum
donec rex causis ex supradictis ei auferret. Fugiens ergo ad
Malcolmum non multo post Flandriam navigio petit. Cui post
aliquantum tempus Scottiam reverso, donavit ei rex supradictus
Dunbar cum adjacentibus terris in LodoneiO, ut ex his, donec
laetiora redirent tempora, se suosque procuraret.f Iste Cospa-
tricus est pater Dolfini, Walthevi et Cospatricist Post Cospatri-
cum datus est comitatus Walthevo Siwardi comitis filio. Quo
postmodum captO, commissa est cura comitatus Walchero epis-
copo usque in diem occisionis suae. Inde rex dedit illum⁷qhono-
rem Albrio. Quo in rebus difficilibus parum valente, patriam-
que reverso, idem rex Rodberto de Mulbreioh dedit comitatum

θ Gospatric purchased the earldom in the autumn or winter of 1067. In
1068 110 fied 10 Scotland, having probably been implicated in the rebellion of
Edwin and Morcar. Robert Oumin, whose murder is recorded A.D. 1069, was
no doubt intended to supersede him. After Cumin's death, notwithstanding that
he was concerned in the insurrection at York in conjunction with the Danish
invasion, the same year, the king accepted his submissim, and allowed him to
retain his government (Reconciliati sunt Guallevus praesens, et Caius-Patricius
absens, sacramento per legatos exhibito. Ordericus, p. 515). This was in 10703
and in 1071 110 was deputed to meet Walcher, the newly-appointed bishop of
Durham, at York, to conduct him from thence to his episcopal residence. All
this time, however, he was indebted less to his sovereign's indulgence than to the
strength of his own position, with the impregnable castle of Bamburgh 10 fall
back upon. For no sooner was William in a position to enforce obedience at the
head os a powerful army on his return from Scotland, than he deprived him of
his earldom on the very charges which had been previously condoned.

s This took place A.D. 1072, within two years of the ravages committed by
Gospatric on the territories of the Scottish king, and the deadly exasperation of
the latter, as detailed above. See note u, p. 86.

g Dolfin was lord of Carlisle, from which he was driven out, ΑΒ. 1092, by
william Rufus, who restored the city and built the castle. VValdeve was lord
os Allerdale, in Cumberland, and Gospatric‚ of Beanley, in Northumberland,
both by grants from Henry I.

ἢ Dugdale makes Geoffrey, Bishop of Coutances, Mowbray's uncle, his pre-
decessor in the earldom, but, as it appears, on insufficient grounds, Geoffrey
was a witness to the foundation charter of the abbey of St. Mary of York, and
is described in the chronicle of that house as having so attested it “ eo tempore,
quo Northymbrorum consulatum regebat.” He probably only acted as deputy
