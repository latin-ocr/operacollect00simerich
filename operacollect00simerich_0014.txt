viii PRE FACE.

Ignoring the real author, he advanced the claims of another
person, Symeon’s superior, the Prior Turgot. The ingenuity
of his argument, and his well-earned reputation for judgment
and learning, secured for his opinions general and unhesitating
acceptance, nor did any one till the lapse of nearly a century
attempt an examination of the basis on which his superstructure
was built. At length a new edition of the Durham History,
based on a MS. unknown to Twysden, was undertaken by
Dr. Bedford‚m and to this was prefixed a dissertation by Rudd,
in which the claims of Symeon were successfully vindicated,
and the erroneous computation exposed.

The publication by the Surtees Society of the work of
Reginald of Coldingham, in which the presence of Symeon at
the disinterment of St. Cuthbert’s remains is distinctly affirmed,
renders it unnecessary to recapitulate Rudd's arguments here,
but they may be read with advantage as a model of close and
accurate reasoning, perfectly conclusive, irrespective of the
corroborative evidence which has since come to light.

The History of the Church of Durham forms no part of the
present publication, being reserved for a second volume, to
which it may not be thought inexpedient to prefix both the
treatise of Selden and the reply of Rudd, and thus to exhibit a
complete view of a discussion which, although now set at rest,
has always exeited peculiar interest amongst historica] enquirers.

Of the voluminous historical materials which have been
printed under the name of Symeon of Durham, two only are
properly described as his works, in the sense in which we apply
the term to the production of a modern writer, the History of
the Clzurch of Durham, and the Account of the Archbislzops of
Yorlc. The History of St. Cuthbert is only a transcript of an
ancient document which has furnished matter for the compila-
tion of the Durham History5 and the tract on the Sieye of
Durham, and the fortunes of Uchtred and his successore, earls
of Nortlzumberlaml, has apparently been transcribed for a kin-
dred purpose, as many of the details have been incorporated in
