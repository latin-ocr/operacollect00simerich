PRE FAC E. xlvii

The series of the kings of Wessex, and their descendants,
kings of England, is brought down to the reign of Henry I.,
who is also mentioned in the account of the earls of North-
umberland as the reigning sovereign, who then held the earldom
in his own hands.

The list of archbishops of Canterbury is brought down to
WilliamA.n.1122-36; of York, to Henry Murdac 1147-533 and
of the bishops of Durham, to William 1143-53 3 which shews Α
11131 11115, although the earliest copy extant, is only a transcript
of an earlier original, and that the York and Durham lists
have been extended to the transcriber's own time.

In MS. Domitian A. viii. , although probably transcribed a
century later, the lists terminate at an earlier period, having
been left without additions as they came from the pen of the
original compiler in the reign of Henry I.

William, as in the other list, occupies the throne of Can-
terbury, but Thurstan, A.D. 1114-39, occurs 36 archbishop of
York, and Ralph Flambard, 1099-1128, as bishop of Durham.
This fixes the date of the original work between the years 1122
and 1128, which is of course quite consistent with the alleged
authorship of Symeon.

The two MSS„ as ’ regards the Saxon history, coincide
except in a very few particulars. MS. Domitian has no rubrics
to the sections, and there are some variations in the arrange-
ment. The kings of Deira immediately follow those of Bernicia
and Northumberland. Then come the archbishops and bishops,
and, last of all, the earls of Northumberland.

To the text of this MS. is appended a list of the counties in
England, classed under the three divisions of Denelaga, Mer-
chenelaga, and Westsexanelaga, which, as it does not occur in
the other MSS„ and has no apparent connection with the
work, is not inserted here, but will be found in the Appendix‚⁰
with other matter of a similar kind.

The Magdalen MS. is of the reign of Stephen, to which
not only the lists of prelates‚ but the narrative itself, is brought
