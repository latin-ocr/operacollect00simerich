parison of these lists, if they had come down to us without
alteration or addition, would have given us the information we
require with a close approximation to complete accuracy; but
we know that it was the almost universal practice of tran-
scribers to continue such lists to their own times, thus oblite-
rating the landmarks of the original authors. This has been q
done by the transcriber of the Cambridge MS„ who brings
down the series of abbats of York to Clement, and of Whitby
to Richard, whose contemporaneous incumbencies extended
from 1161 to 1175, thus fixing the date of transcription between
those years, whilst the character of the handwriting, as reported
on by Mr. Raine, points to the later rather than the earlier
year.

The Abridyment of Symeon, however, to which allusion has
already been made as existing in the Cottonian Library, pre-
sents us with farther information. This MS„ which is un-
questionably of earlier date than that on which our text is
founded, closes the series of York abbats with the name of
Godfrey, who was appointed in 1132, and only enjoyed his
dignity one year. This date approximates so closely to that at
which the chronicle closes, that we are tempted to assume that
we have the list without alteration by the epitomist, just as it
came out of the author’s hands, and that the year 1132 reprc-
sents the precise date of the¹ compilation; or, even if it is the
date of the abridgment, the original work must have been
finished between the year 1129, to which the narrative ‘ is
brought down, and 1132, in which it was epitomized. Unfor-
tunately, however, the Abbrevz'atz'o extends only to 1119, and
the only positive testimony which we derive from it is that
certain of the interpolations had been inserted in the text of
Florence, and the joint work of Florence and his interpolator
had been epitomized as early as 1132. This leads to the infer-
ence that in 1132 Symeon’s continuation was unknown to the
public, or at all events to the epitomist, although carried out
in the meantime in the privacy of his cell.

It is well known that the History of Roger Hoveden is
based to a great extent upon the Historia Reyum, and that hc
