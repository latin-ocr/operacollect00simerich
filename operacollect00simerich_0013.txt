about the same time, or perhaps a little later. It is dedicated
to Hugh, dean of York, of whose tenure of that dignity we
have evidence in 1130 and 1133. Symeon must at that time
have been between seventy and eighty, and it is probable that
his life did not extend long beyond the period of his literary
labours.

Such are the few particulars which are known to us of ’
Symeon of Durham, and even these, although they are derived
almost exclusively from his own testimony, have not been
. accepted without question.

The rubrio prefixed to his History of the Kings of the
Angles and Danes, in the only existing MS„ represents the
work as extending from the death of the Venerable Beda to the
latter part of the reign of Henry L, an interval, as is erro-
neously stated, of 429 years. Nojw Beda died A.D. 737, and
the addition of 429 years to this date brings us down to 1166,
which has been adopted by one commentator after another as
the era of Symeon's authorship, ignoring altogether the facts,
that the reign of Henry I. terminated in 1135, and the History
is actually carried no farther than 1129. On such grounds
Bale asserts that Symeon flourished A.D. 1166, and his assertion
has been accepted as conclusive by Selden, who contributed an
essay to Twysden's great work, the Decem ScriptoreS,l in which
he undertakes to prove that Symeon was not the author of the
History of the Church of Durham. Nor was the task a diffi-
cult one, assuming his premises to have been correct. We
may readily admit that an individual who flourished in 1166
could hardly spcak from his own recollection of matters which
occurred previous to 1080, the year of Bishop Walcher’s death;
nay, further, we can hardly identify him with one of the senior
brethren of his convent who assisted at the translation of St.
Cuthbert in 1104. Either we must reject the authority of
Bale, or deprive Symeon of the credit of a work on which his
reputation as an historical writer mainly dependS, and Selden
adopted the latter alternative. But he did more than this.
