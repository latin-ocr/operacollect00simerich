twenty-six, but thirty-six years. He then tells us that Regnold
reigned ten years, and his brother Sihtric a few years, 31101·
whom came his son Guthferth, who was expelled by Athelstan
A.1). 926. This chronology is framed 011 1110 assumption that
Regnold succeeded immediately on the death of Eowils and
Halfdene, placing the termination of his reign A.D. 921, and
allowing five years for the reigns 01 81111110 and Guthferth.
But Regnold was engaged in Ireland long 31101 911,ῑ and his
connection with Northumberland commenced with the incur-
sion in which he besieged and took York, which is fixed by
the Saxon Chronicle A.D. 923, by the Historia Reyum 919J
In 924 110 1113ᾶο submission to Edward the Elder, and the
following year he was expelled. The Saxon Chronicle allows
only one year 101 1110 reign 01 81111110, placing his death in
926, and the expulsion 01 Guthferth in 927. It is remarkable
that- the Liber de Adventu Sermonum makes no mention 01
Regnold at all, nor does it from this period furnish us with a
single name 01 311 11101ᾰο111 01 Northumbrian history down to
the expulsion 01 Ε1110, 1110 last king of that province, with
which we are not acquainted from other sources. The Historia
Reyum, on the other hand, whilst following 101 1110 most part
the authority of the Saxon Chronicle, gives important details
from some independent authorityjc probably, as has been
suggested, from a continuation 01 those annals on which the
earlier portion of it is altogether basedJ

i In 915 Regnold and Sihtric landed in Ireland; one at Kildare, the other
at Waterford. From this time they appear from the Irish Annals to have
exercised a joint authority until A.D. 918, when their brother Guthferth, or
Godfrey, made himself master of Dublin, and assumed the> chief command,
which he retained till his death ΑΛ). 932.

J The latter was probably the true date, as the events of Regnold's reign, as
recorded in the Historia Cuthberti, the Historia Regum, the Pictish Chronicle,
and other authorities, would scarcely have been compressed within a period 01
two years.
