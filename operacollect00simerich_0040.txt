and is besides valuable for the purpose of comparing its style
with other portions of ‘the works ascribed to Symeon, with a
view to determine some questions bearing upon their author-
ship. The additions, moreover, are so few that there is no
difficulty in distinguishing them, as there is in the case of the
additions to Florence, which, although comparatively small in
bulk, are considerable in number.

IV. Epis-tle to Deam Hugh, concerniny the Archbishops of
York. This little piece is contained in the same MS. volume
in the Library of C. C. College, Cambridge, from which the
History of tlze Kinys of the Anyles and Danes is taken, but the
text adopted in this edition is from another transcript in the
Cottonian Library,‘’ which, although of comparatively modern
date, undoubtedly represents an earlier and more accurate
original. It has been collated also with a modern copy amongst
the Hale MSS. in the Library of Lincoln’s Inn,⁶ but this
turns out to be only a very faulty transcript of the C. C.
volume. >The narrative of the Acts of the Archbishops extends

971, but the names of his successors are given down to Arch-
bishop Thurstan, A.D. 1114-1143. The list is further ex-
tended in the Cambridge MS. to Archbishop Roger, whose
primacy comprised the interval from 1154 to 1181, thus con-

latter being the popular name, the former the Saxon equivalent for Coitmawr,
or Magna Silva, Selwood Forest. The less material deviations are numerous.

ᾖ Titus A. xix, a small quarto on paper, of the fifteenth century, written
probably by a York scribe, as the same hand occurs in other MSS. connected
with Yorkshire in the British Museum. It was probably transcribed at York
from the original, or at all events from a copy of earlier date than the Cambridge

MSg MS. Hale, vol. xiii„ in a hand of the seventeenth century.
