⁶ This extract is from William of Malmesbury’s History of the Kings of
England‚ book ii„ chapters ii. and iii„ and contains the'genealogy of the West-
Saxon kings from Ethelwlf upwards to WVoden‚ and so to Noah through his
fourth son Stres‚ who is said to have been born in the Ark; also an account of the
division of the kingdom on the death of Ethelwlf between his sons Ethelbald
and Ethelbert, and of the death of the former. It ends abruptly in the midst
of the account of the Danish invasion in the reign of Ethelbert. See the
History of1 Williaq} of Malmesbury as published by the English Historia-al
