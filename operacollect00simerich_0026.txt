XX PREFACE.

erroneously dated by Malmesbury. Swebreht als0‚ king of the
East Saxons, whose death is recorded A.1). 738, is noticed by
no other author. Again, in 740, we read, “Arwine‚ the son
of Eadulf, was slain.'’ Eadulf was one of the petty kings who
ruled in separate districts of Kent at that period, unnoticed by
historians, but known to us by a charter bearing his name in
the Textus Roffensis. The Northumberland Annals appended
to Beda mention his death, without noticing his parentage ,α
by no other historian is any mention made of him. Under the
year 749 the following statement occurs in 0111· text, which is
not to be met with elsewhere: “AElfwald, king of the East
Angles, died. Η1111110311113ὀ and Alberht divided his kingdom
between them.”

As regards the Fasti of the English Church we have much
exclusive information. We find the succession of the bishops
of Lindsea,⁶ and the names of many bishops of the Mercian
sees ,ά notices of the consecration of two bishops of Selsea,⁶
and of one of each of the dioceses of Hereford, Sherbnrn, and
Ε11111131113]ο of the deaths of two bishops of Londonffl and one
of Rochesterst all unnoticed by the Saxon Chronicle, in common
with which we have also lists of the archbishops of Cantcrbury
and York, and of the bishops of Lindisfarne, >Hexham, and
Whitherne.

α “Aruuini 01 Eadbertus intersecti.'' We have no clue 10 1110 identity of
Radbertus, if indeed the reading is correct.

note to the translation of Lappenberg’s Enyland under the Anylo-Saxon Κὶηῃε,
