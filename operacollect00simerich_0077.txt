PREFACE, PART 1. lxxi

Fol. 165 a, is a blank leaf on which is written in a fifteenth
century hand the speech of the men of Galloway at the battle
of the Standard—as given by Aelred.

Foll. 165 b—175 b. Rubrio. “ Incipit eulogium brevissimum
Britanniae insulae quod Ninnius Elvodugi discipulus congre-
gavit.''

I have omitted to copy the first and last words of this and
the next tract.

This MS. of Nennius has many curious interpolations and
additions.

Foll. 175 b—].7 8. Rubrio. “Vita sanctissimi atque doc-

On the fly leaves, at the end, are a few genealogica] and
historica] notes of no value‚ and in a late hand.

Some of the tracts at the end of the volume are of a later
date than their predecessors, but I should say that there is
nothing later than the reign of king John.

The date of the Corpus MS. is probably about 1180. It is
later than the MS. of Symeon in Bishop Cosin's library at Dur-
ham, as well as inferior to it in execution. The Corpus MS. of
Symeon is done by the same hand that wrote the History of the
Church of Hexham by Prior Richard, which is in the Cambridge
University Library, and probably by the same hand that wrote
’ Symeon's History of the Church of Durham, Beda's Eccle-
siastical History, and Ethelwold’s account of the abbats of Lin-
disfarne, which occur in the same volume. These three are
better executed than the others, and, if not by the same hand,
have at all events been written in the same place.

The date of the rubrio at the beginning is perhaps a little
later than the MS„ but not much. From the allusion in it to
Henry I. it is obvious that the writer knew of Henry IL, who
became king in 1154.

The Historia Reyum is carelessly written in several hands
and inks. The portion arranged under years is tolerably evenly
done, and by one hand probably. The extracts about Ethelbert
and Ethelred‚ the genealogy of the kings, the notices of Benedict
and Ceolfrid, the poetical extracts from Beda, and that from
