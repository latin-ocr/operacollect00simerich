are several other works of great interest, whilst others are of
inferior value.

The editorial labours in respect to this publication have
been performed in a manner much more creditable than in the
case of the majority of the early editions of our mediaeval
historians. The text generally is tolerably correct, and the
mistakes which occur are much more frequently due to the
transcriber of the MS. than to the editor of the printed
volume. This especially applies to the frequent errors in the
orthography of proper nameS, in most cases originating in the
substitution of one Saxon character for another of nearly
similar form.

No attempt has been made by Twysden to ascertain the
authorship of the several pieceS, or to discriminate between those
which are really the productions of Symeon, and those of older
date which have been mixed with them. Prefixed to the volume
indeed is Selden’s essay already referred to, which seeks to
award to another pen the merit of the History of the Clzurch of
Durlzam ; but this, if an exception, is an unfortunate one.
Neither has the text in any case been illustrated by such notes
as are absolutely essential to the general reader.

The MSS. used by Twysden are contained in two folio
volumes, both of which were formerly the property of arch-
bishop Parker, by whose liberality one was consigned to the
Public Library at Cambridge, the other to that of C. C. College
in the same University. Of both these volumes we have already
spoken. From the MS. in the Public Library Twysden has
printed the History of the Clzurch os Durham, with the His-
toria-al and Topoyraphz'cal Eoetracts printed at p. 217 of the
present volume 3 the Continuatz'on of the above History 3 and
the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto, with certain charters and
illustrative documents appended to it and to the Continuatz'on.
From the C. C. manuscript he has printed the two Tracts on
the archbislzops of Yorlc, and on the sieye of Durlzam; 'and the
History of tlze Kinys of the Anyles and Danes, including under
that title not only the two pieces which precede it in this
volume, but the long extracts from Beda above referred to.
