The Society has taken up another subject which is an interest-
ing one at all timeS, more especially at the present. The Articles
and Injunctions of the heads of the church within the northern
province have never appeared in a collected form. Some of
them are known through the valuable although ponderous work
of Wilkins, and others are to be met with in other publicationS,
but a complete edition of these curious and important codes of
local ecclesiastic-al rules has never been made. This it will be
the object of the Society to supply.

A third work⁷ which is being prepared for publication, may be
briefly mentioned. It is the Ephemeris or Diurnal of Abraham
De la Pryme‚ a Yorkshire antiquary in the time of William III.
and Queen Anne. The manuscript collections of this scholar are
widely scattered and are little known, but the appearance of his
Diary will give a fair insight into the character and feelings of
one of those topographical labourers whose exertions have done
honour to the county of York.
