xxiv PREFACE.

of ornamentation 3 but whenever an opportunity presented itself,
as in the list of the archbishops of Canterbury, at page 12,
we at once detect the finger of the paraphrast of Asser, and the
Northumbrian genealogy. The detached sentences which form
the continuation are again in the simplest language. We have
already pointed out the very few additions which this compiler
has inserted in the narrative of Asser. His interpolations in
the earlier annals are yet fewer. Two only have been detected,
both of which occur at page 18, and are referred to in the notes
below (q and u).â€”The reference in the former to the Saxon
Chronicle is characteristic of a writer who has drawn so much
of his additional matter from that source. There can be little
doubt that the other is from the same pen 3 at all events it was
not introduced by Symeon, who was himself the author of a
History of the Archbishops of York, and well acquainted with
the position in their series of the second Wilfrid, whose name
has caused so much perplexity in the passage referred to.

There are, however, two interpolations of much greater
length which can neither be referred to the reign of Edward
the Confessor, nor yet to the pen of Symeon in the following
century. These occur at pages 14-17, and 26-28, and con-
sist of Legends respecting the two canonized bishops of Hexham,
Acca and Alchmund, not only directly at variance with the
statements of Symeon, in his History of the Church of Durham,
but obviously introduced for the very purpose of contradicting
those statements. Symeon tells us (iii. 7), amongst other meri-
torious actions of the pious priest Alured, that he employed
himself in the collection of the bones of the illustrious Saints,
whose remains lay scattered amidst the ruins of the monasteries
and churches of Northumberland, a portion of all of which, in-
cluding relics of Acca and Alchmund, he conveyed to Durham,
and deposited in the tomb of St. Cuthbert. The Legends, on
the contrary, inform us that the relics remain at Hexham, not
abone absent from its proper place 3 and all this is accompanied
by details well calculated to make a deep impression on a credu-
lous age, and effectually to dispose of the testimony of Symeon,
without making any direct reference to it.
