PREFACE. lxv

I have further to‘ discharge a pleasing duty in acknow-
ledging my obligations to other friends.

To J oseph Burtt, Esq., Assistant-Keeper of the Public
Records, for the pains which he took in collating the Hale MS.
of the tract on the archbishops of York, with the Cambridge
transcript, and also in examining a work in the same collection,
which was supposed to resemble the Historia Cuthbertz‘, and
sending me numerous extracts which shewed the fallacy of that
view. The same gentleman kindly superintended the transcrip-
tion of two MSS. of the Translations of St. Cuthbert in the
British Museum, and of the MS. Caligula A. viii. of the Liber
cle Adventu Saoeonum.

To Mr. Walbran, so favourably known to the members of
the Surtees Society by his volume of the Memorials of Foun-
tains Abbey, and other works, for an elaborate report on the
volume in the British Museum containing the Liber de Adventu
Saoeonum and the Abbreviatio Sym-conis, and for his examination
of a second MS. of the former work in the same repository. I
should have printed Mr. W albran's report in eoetenso, if I had
not been induced by the great importance of the work to which
it refers, to include it in this collection, ‚thus rendering a
detailed account unnecessary.

To Mr. Longstaffe I am indebted for a minute description
. of a MS. volume of historica] materials in the Library of the
dean and chapter of Durliam, containing, inter alia, a transcript
of the same work, De Adventu Saoeomcm, With numerous inter-
polations and additions, from which he furnished me with
copious extractS.

In addition to the printed works of Symeon in the editions

to which I have referred, Ι have not failed to avail myself of ·

the information contained in the preface and notes to Mr.
Stevenson's translation, published in the Church Historians of
England.

I cannot forbear expressing my obligations to two works of
national importance, the Monumenta Historica Britannica,
which will remain a monument to all ages of the learning,
judgment, and industry of the late Mr. Pctrie, and to the
