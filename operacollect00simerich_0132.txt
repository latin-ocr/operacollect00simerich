Defuncto rege glorioso Brychtric0‚ Occidentalis regni sus-
cepit post ipsius obitum regnum et imperium Ecgberht rex, qui,
ex regali illius gentis prosapia exortus, diadema totius regni
capiti imposuit maximo sceptro redimitus. Erat enim strenuis-
simus vir et potens, multaque regna suo subjecit imperio. Reg-
navit annis xxxvj.² Et Ecgberhto successit Ethelwlfus filius
ejus potentissimus.“ Cui successit filius ejus Ethelbaldus. De-
inde frater suus Ethebyrtus. Post quem frater suus Ethelredus.
Post hunc frater eorum Elfredus. Denique Ethelwlf habuit ex
conjuge sua nobilib iiij filios, scilicet Ethelbaldum et Etlielbirtum
et Etelredum et Alfredum,⁶ qui omnes sibi invicem in regnum
successerunt.

is more vituperative and the quotations are interpolated. What follows seems
to have been part of the original narrative, which has been interrupted by the
introduction of the story os Eadburga from Asser.

² The words from erat enim are at the foot of the page.

'¹ This word is an interlineation.

⁶ The words ex oonjuye sua nobili are interlined.

⁶ These words are crowded together at the foot of the page. So also are the
events of the next three years. There is evidently a break in the MS. here.
With the year 849 it goes on with a fresh page in a neater and more orderly
hand.

‘¹ This sentence is incomplete3 and there appears to have been a considerable
hiatus iu the text from which the O. O. G. manuscript has been copied (see Petris,
Mon. Hist„ p. 673). Twysden has attempted an amendment by transferring the
words ‘⁶' ei successit'' from the next paragraph in the MS. to the end of the pre-
sent, and has thus completed the first sentence, and has also got rid of the anomaly
which the text in its mutilated state presents, of making Celnod appear to have
been the successor of Egbert‚ whereas the former was archbishop of Canterbury,
the latter bishop of Lindisfarne. He still, however, leaves an interval os twenty-
seven years unaccounted for3 during which two archbishops occupied the see of
Canterbury‚ and one bishop, Heathured, succeeded to that of Lindisfarne‚ all of
whom probably appeared in their proper order in the MS. previous 10 118 mutila-
tion. An attempt has been made to supply the omission as regards Heathured‚
by an insertion in the C. C. O. manuscript3 but this has been made erroneously
under the year 891, instead of 819. Refer to Aa). 891, below.

⁶ This cntry is inserted at the bottom of the page in the MS.
