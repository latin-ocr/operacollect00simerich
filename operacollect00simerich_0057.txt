Neither the Liber de Adventu Saoeonum, nor the Historia
Romam, give us any intimation of the state of affairs in
Northumberland on the death of Guthred3 but Symeon, in his
History of the Charclz of Barbam, informs us that Alfred took
the government into his own handsst Even then indeed the
Danes had leaders of their own, whom they dignified with the
title of kings, but their authority seems to have been persona]
rather than territorial. Each could command the services of
an organized host of his countrymen wherever the prospect of

plunder tempted him 3 but they reigned over no particular ,

locality ,- and we hear of them now in Northumberland, and
now in Essex, Mercia, or East Anglia. When, on the accession
of Edward the Elder to the throne of England, his cousin
Ethelwald fied into Northumberland, he was received by these
petty reyulz‘, and acknowledged as “king and prince of the
kings.'' Such is the statement of Henry of Huntingdon, an
historian well informed on northern affairs, who further ex-
plains that the “Danish kings reigned in a confused manner,
sometimes two, sometimes three, at the same time.”

Ethelwald was slain A.D. 905, and the following year we
find “king Edward from necessity concluded a peace with the
army both of East Anglia and of Northumberland,” over which
these reyulz' now held command, freed from the control of any
superior. ’

In 911, “the army among the Northumbrians broke the
peace,'’ and being defeated by the forces of king Edward, two
of their kings, Eowils and Halfdene, were slain. Florence of
VVorcester, by a strange mistake, confounds this Halfdene with
his namesake, who was the scourge of the previous generation,
and assigns to him a reign of twenty-six years, but the actual
interval from Halfdene's accession to the year 911 is not
