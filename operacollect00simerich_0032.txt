thought desirable to reproduce, but references are given in the
noteS, by which they may readily be found in the pages of the
original author. The rubricist of the MS. has distinguished by
the title of “Recapitulatio” that portion of the second part
which extends over the same period, which has been already
gone over in the first, although after the death of Alfred they
have scarcely anything in common. The remainder is described
as “ Continuati0.''

The History of Florence, in all the copies with which we are
acquainted, is made to close with the year 1117, a few months
previous to the death of its author,- but there is reason to believem
that his labours terminated some years earlier. It seems to
have been brought down to 1119, probably by the same hand
which afterwards continued it to 1141, and to have been at once
made public. At all events Symeon commences his continua-
tion at the former date. Amongst the interpolations are two
long extractS, the first at p. 74 concerning J ohannes Scotus
from Malmesbury's Life of Aldhelm 3 the second at p. 81, ex-
plaining the conflicting claims of Harold and William to the
crown of England, extracted from Eadmer's Historia Novorum.

There are also several notices of Rollo and his successorS,
Dukes of Normandy, from some authority resembling the
Chronicle of Caen.

Ecgbert and Ricsig, who are mentioned by Symeon as reign-
ing beyond the Tyne after the disruption of the Northumbrian
monarchy by the DaneS, are also noticed here ,- and the date
of the latter’s death, and the name of his successor, a second
Ecgbert, are also given with otherparticulars, apparently unknown
to Symeon, which have probably been derived from the Gesta
Anylorum, referred to by Adam of Bremen. Many other par-
ticulars are also given from Symeon's History of tlze Ckurclz of
Durham, and some extracts are made from the brief chrono-
logical notes in the first part of the History after the death
of Alfred. The extracts from the History of Durham have
certainly not been made by Symeon himself, as in many cases
