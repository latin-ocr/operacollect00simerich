bury 3. to him succeeded his brother Ethelred, the father of
King Edward, whom he had begotten of Emma.''

This affords us some clue to the date at which the materials
comprised in the first part were put together, certainly not
earlier than the reign of Edward the Confessor, whose name is
here introduced as king, and there are reasons for supposing
that it was not later. Surely if it had been written under any
of the succeeding kings of the Norman dynasty some allusion
would have been made to that stupendous revolution which
overwhelmed the Anglo-Saxon commonwealth on Edward's
death. Neither in the list of kings from Edgar to Edward
would it have ignored altogether the reigns of Suane, Cnute,
Harold and Hardicnute. We can understand the feeling
that might still prevail in the reign of Edward the Confessor,
which would repudiate the Danish monarchs as usurpers, and
exclude them from the regal list 3 but such a feeling could have
no existence after the Conquest. If, again, this genealogical
summary had been written after Edward's death, his name
would hardly have been brought thus prominently forward
without some expression of the fond veneration in which his
memory was held by his countrymen in aftertimes. Symeon
has occasion to refer to him twice in his History of the Church
of Durham, and on both occasions applies the prefix of “the
most pious king ’² (iii. 9, 14). That the same hand was em-
ployed in shaping the first and second portions of the first part
of the History of the Kings of the Angles and Danes, will

scarcely admit of dispute. The same exaggerated style pervades .

both, founded in each case upon the same model 3 on the Passion
of St. Ethelbert and St. Ethelred 3 which, with the Genealogy of
the Kings of Northumberland, clothed in the same florid para-
phrase, seems to have formed the collections of an anonymous
student in the reign of Edward the Confessor.

It is true that the same grandiloquent phraseology does not
so universally pervade the annals of the eighth century, as the
subsequent extracts from Asser, but this is due to the nature
of the material to be operated upon. The brief notes of which
the annals chiefly consist, were hardly susceptible of this species
