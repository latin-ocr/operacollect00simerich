THE SURTEES SOOIETY.

 

REPORT FOR THE YEAR MDCCQLXVII.

WITH regard to the progress 01 the Surtees Society during the past
year, it is almost superfluous to say that it enjoys its customary
prosperity. Our finances are in a satisfactory condition. Our
list of members is full, and the candidates for admission are more
numerous than the vacancies.

In consequence of the unexpected bulk of 1116 two volumes
for 1866, the Society has resolved to issue one only for the cur-
rent year. This is the first part of the writings ascribed to an
ancient northern chronicler, Symeon of Durham. Hitherto the
chief work of this well-known author has been overlaid with a
vast and unnecessary series of extracts from earlier writers.
One of the main objects of the editor of the Surtees edition has
been to throw these aside‚ and to present nothing to the reader
with which the name of Symeon cannot be intimately connected,

. whether these materials appear as the production of his own pen,

or 35 1116 handiwork of others of which he has availed himself.
In an appendix several valuable tractates have been given, the
most interesting of which is the account of the Translations of
the body of St. Cuthbert, the greater portion of which has never
been in print before. The best thanks of the Society are due to
the editor, not merely for his labour, but for the pecuniary 35515-
tance he has given to enable the Society to ensure the complete-
ness of the volume.

Several volumes are at the present time in a state of prepar-
· 311011. The first is the Correspondence of John Cosin‚ the well-
known Bishop of Durham. Recent and careful investigations
have added largely to the information we possess about this 13-
mous prelate. N umerous letters to and from him have been
discovered3 and the present volume will contain a remarkable
and hitherto unknown body of correspondence between him and
Richard Montague, before they were raised to the bench.
