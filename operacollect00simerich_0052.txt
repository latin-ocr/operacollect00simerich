MS. Cotton, Domitian, viii.,a MS. liii. ll, in the Library of
Magdalen College, Oxford 3²² and MS. B„ xi. 35, in the Library
of the Dean and Chapter of Durham.⁶

We will first describe the contents as we find them in the
Cotton MS. , prefixed to the Abbrevz'atz'o Symeom‘sfl This copy,
like all the otherS, commences with a long extract from NenniuS,
containing the description of Britain, with other particulars,
which have been omitted in the present volume. The proper
contents are as follow. First, the genealogies of the royal
families of Kent, Mercia, Wessex, Bernicia and Deira, from
Woden downwards. Next follows an account of the settlement
in Britain of the Saxons, Angles and Jutes, and then the succes-
sion of the kings of all the states of the Heptarchy, Sussex
excepted, in the following order: l. Kings of Kent; 2. Of
East Anglia3 3. Of Essex, 4. Of Mercia3 5. Of Wessex3
6. Kings of Bernicia, and, subsequently, of Northumberland3
7. Earls of Northumberland 3 8. Kings of Deira.

To these is appended a list of the founders of the several
kingdoms3 and then an enumeration in the order of thcir
succession of the archbishops of Canterbury and Yorkj and
the bishops of Lindisfarne, and, afterwards, of Durham. Then
follows the Abbrevz’atz'o SymeoniS.

'¹ Vellum, quarto, thirteenth century.

⁶ Quarto, not later than the beginning of the reign of Stephen. At the
commencement, in a hand of the beginning of the sixteenth century, is written,
‘⁶ Chronicon monachi cuj usdam Dunelmensis.''

⁰ See Mr. Longstaffe's description of this MS. in Appendix to Preface.

ἆ The following description is from ΜΓ. Walbran's report :—“ The characters
of the MS. refer it to the middle of the twelfth century. The handwriting is of
the larger bold character of the period, with plain painted capital letters, with
the exception of two, which have a little foliation. The text commences without
any leading rubrio. At the head of the first page is written in a hand of the
seventeenth century, perhaps that of Sir Robert Cotton, whose signature is at
the foot, Chronieon Symeom's monachi Dunelmensis. After a page and a half of
introductory matter from Nennius is a curicus illuminated head of Woden,
crowned, with the heads of six of his sons disposed around‚ with genealogies
below each. Thus under the head of a grave-looking personage, with yellow
curly hair and a long heard, wearing a pyramidal cap, is written, ‘W oden
genuit Beldei‚' '³ etc. 'Phe MS. is on vellum, and in quarto.
