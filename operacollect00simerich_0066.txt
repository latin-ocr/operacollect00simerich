lx PREFACE.

this name 3. but here again a difficulty arises from the lowness
of his position on the roll, where he stands the hundred and thirty-
first in order. If the transcriber of the MS. had no better
ground than the occurrence of the initial T. in 'Pheoderic for
selecting him as the author, there are no less than five other
monks whose names equally satisfy this condition, and who
precede Theoderic in the date of their profession. Turkil
stands eighth, just two below Turgot, and Thurstan seventy-
sixth, being thirty-eight below Symeon. There are two of the
name of Thomas who stand eighty-third and eighty-sixth, and
another called Turold, eighty-ninth. Even the last of these,
although apparently too low on the roll, stands earlier by forty-
two than Theoderic. But for the objection stated above, the
claims of Turgot would unquestionably be superior to those
of any other, whilst those of Theoderic, except so far as the
authority of the MS. supports them, are inferior to all. If
Theoderic really was the author, and as such, the friend and
confidant of queen Margaret, we can only reconcile the fact
with his position on the roll by supposing that he entered the
monastery in extreme old age many years afterwards.

Pinkerton’s volume, of which only one hundred copies were
printed, has become so scarce as to be even more difficult of
access than the voluminous Acta Sanctorum from Which it was
taken, and a new edition of this tract has long been a deside-
ratum.

APPENDIX, No. IV. Fordun's Extracts from Turyot. Of
these extracts, a few words in the fourthss and nearly the whole
vof the fiftha are from the Life of Queen Margaret, printed above,
which is there referred to as “The Legend of the Life of the
Blessed Queen.”b By far the greater part of the remainder is
from the Genealoyy of the Kinys of Enylcmd by Aelred of Rie-
vaulx, as will be seen by a reference to the notes. The part
'which is unaccounted for is probably taken from some other
work of the same author, whose writings are very numerous,
and some are not now known to exist. Amongst others a Life
