earliest authority for the statement of the transfer of the dis-
trict of Lothian to the crown of Scotland by Eadulf Cudel, earl
of Northumberland. It is, however, of less value historically‚
than as illustrative of the usages and manners of the timeS.
We find a married bishop portioning his daughter out of the
property of his see. We have instanceS, especially in reference
to the Bishop's daughter, of the facility of divorce3 and a most
remarkable case of deadly feud, continued through three gene-
rations. We have a curicus notice of the obligation of duelling.
Cospatric the son of Archil is distinguished from others of the
same name, as the individual who ought to have fought with
Waltheof the son of Ailsi. As a mirror of every-day life
amongst the influentia] classes in Northumberland, in the first
half of the eleventh century, we have no such instructive docu-
ment. It belongs to an age prior to Symeon, but he has not
made use of it to the extent we might have expected. He
details the assistance given by Uchtred to the Bishop in clear-
ing the foundations for his new settlement at Durham, but he
passes unnotieed the siege which is here recorded. This was
probably owing to the difficulty occasioned by an error in the
date, pointed out in the notes, which may in his judgment
have cast a doubt on the statement altogether, and on the
credibility of the writer.

VIII. History of the Translations of St. Cutlzbert. This
work has been compiled within a short time of the establish-
ment of the monastery of Durham, and has received additions
from time to time, until it assumed its present shape. One
ancient copy, still extant,⁸ contains only the first seven chapters,
and we have proof that in its original state it consisted of only
six. These six chapters must have been in existence when
Symeon composed his History of the Churclz of Durlzam during
the priorate of Turgot, which only extended to the year 1109,
as we have ample evidence that it was in his hands whilst he
was employed upon that work. On the other hand it is equally
certain that the seventh chapter was not written until after the

³ MS. Harl„ 1924.
