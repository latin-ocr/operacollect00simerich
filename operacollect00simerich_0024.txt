xviii PREFACE.

· from being a connection or ally of the ruling monarch, was
the last remaining descendant of an elder and antagonistic
branch of the house of Ida. Eadbert followed but the instinct
of his race in pursuing the rightful heir to the crown with
unrelenting severity, and even tearing him from the sanctuary
of the altar, whilst the bishop drew upon himself the anger of
his sovereign by admitting the fugitive to this ineffectual
asylum.

Not only has Symeon availed himself of these ancient
annals in the compilation of his History of the Churclc of Durkam
up to the year 803, »where they terminate imperfectly in our
copy, but he seems to have followed an unmutilated text to a
much later date, for he gives us the succession of the North-
umbrian kings from that period to the disruption of the mo-
narchy in 867 ,y and, after that, the reigns of two petty princes,
Ecgbert and Ricsigf, whose dominions were limited to the terri-
tory north of the Tyne 3 which particulars are not to be found
in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, nor, so far as we are aware, in
any other authority which existed at the time he wrote. From
this date indeed the character of his history is altogether
changed. It is no longer a continuous narrative, but a series
of unconnected anecdotes and miracles, often separated by
considerable intervals of time, and generally traceable, where
the matter is historical, to existing sources, The inference
seems clear that the authority which had guided him from the
close of Beda’s History had suddenly failed, nor need we be
surprised that it should be so, when we remember that at this
precise period, in the reign of Ricsig, the devastations of Half-
dene occurred, overwhelming in one common ruin all the mo-
nasteries of Northumberland, and that the monkS, the only
historians of the age, were either slain or hopelessly dispersed.
We have seen that in these annals the church of Hexham is
represented as existing in its pristine magnificence and integrity,
and so it did remain till this calamitous period, but scarcely
had the pen dropped from the hand of the writer, when it was
:reduced to a scorched and blackened ruin.
