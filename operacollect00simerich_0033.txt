they have been so altered as to differ essentially from his
narrative. This applies particularly to the account of the
possessions of the church of Lindisfarne at p. 67, and of the
settlement of Aldwine and his brethren first at Monkchester
and afterwards at Jarrow, at p. 94, as will be seen by a reference
to the notes. Appended to the latter narrative is a romantic
legend of the life of Turgot, which is unsupported by Symeon
or any independent authority.

At p. 79 is a notice of the disastrous battle at Carham,
A.D. 1018, of which we have the particulars in the History of
the Church of Durham, but here we have a statement utterly
uncountenanced by Symeon, that Earl Uchtred was the leader
of the Northumbrian forces in the engagement, although we
know from Florence, as copied a few pages before, that he had
been treacherously slain two years previously.

The most unaccountable discrepancy, however, occurs in the
account, at p. 103, of the ceremony of laying the foundation of
the new cathedral at Durham, a narrative of which we have also
a description in thework of Symeon, which is specially devoted
to the honour of his Churohst According to him the ceremony
was performed by the bishop, William de St. Carileph, and Prior
Turgot, assisted only by the monks3 whilst in the history before
us,0 Malcolm king of Scotland is represented not merely as
being present, but as having taken an active part in the solem-
nity. The co-operation of a sovereign prince on such an occa-
sion was too memorable an event to have been omitted by an
historian so warmly interested, and who could not have been
ignorant of it, if there were any truth in the story. Neither
were the relations between the parties of so amicable a kind as
to induce us to accept the statement as authentic without satis-
factory proof. Not many years previously Turgot had been
driven from the retirement which he sought amidst the shades
of Melrose, hallowed by the memory of his patron Saint, by the
unceasing persecutions of the Scottish king.1⁹
