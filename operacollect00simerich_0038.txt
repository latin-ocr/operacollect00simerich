xxxii PREFACE.

has transcribed verbatim a large proportion of both the parts.
It further appears from the series of abbats in his work, that
the MS. from which he transcribed must have been of inter-
mediate date between that used by the editor of the Abbreviatz'o,
and the Cambridge MS„ written whilst Severinus, the imme-
diate successor of Godfrey, was abbat of St. Mary's at York,
which position he held till his death in 1161. The ancient
annals in the First Part, which were unquestionably perfect to
a much later period, when Symeon compiled his History of the
Church of Durham, must already have been mutilated when
Hoveden's MS. was transcribed3 and the particulars which
have been inserted to fill up the gap between the year 801 and
the birth of Alfred had already been transposed from their
proper place in Asser's biography for that purpose. These
particulars are retained by Hoveden, but he makes no farther
use of the paraphrase of Asser in our text, nor of the brief
notices which follow it.

It does not appear that the MS. from which the Abbrevz'atz‘o
was made contained the first part ,- at all events no use has been
made of it, but the two parts must have been united previous
to the transcription of the MS. which Hoveden copied, as that
unquestionably contained farther additions, which are not in
the Cambridge MS. Alured of Beverley also made use of
both parts in the compilation of his History, which we know
was written about A.D. 1143st

’ The second part is twice referred to by Fordun,² once as an
authority for the presence of Malcolm at the foundation of
Durham cathedral, when he quotes it as the work of Turgot,
and, secondly, for the details of certain events antecedent to the
marriage of that king with the princess Margaret, when he
describes it anonymously as “ an old chronicle.” Nowhere
does he speak of Symeon as the author, nor does he appear to

have been acquainted with Symeon’s genuine work, the History
of the Church of Durham.
