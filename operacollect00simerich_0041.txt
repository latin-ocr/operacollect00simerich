PREFACE. XXXV

this name in Symeon's time, the first between the years 1090
and 1109, the second from 1130 to 1132. As, however, the
latter was also the contemporary of archbishop Thurstan, there
can be no doubt that he is the person addressed. In the text
followed in the present volume the narrative portion precedes
the epistolary3 in the C. C. volume the order is reversed. The
other variations, which are not very material, are pointed out in
the notes. Some of the names have been modernized in the
Cotton MS., and Arabic numerals have been substituted for
Roman. The latter are restored in the text.

There can be no doubt that we have here a genuine work
of Symeon, as it is authenticated by his name in the body of
the epistle. It is not, however, a production of much value, as
it contains no information which is not to be met with else-
where. We have notice here of the reigns of Egbert and
Ricsig, who are also mentioned in the His-lory of tlze Cleurclz of
Durham, and whose names are only known to us from the
works of Symeon and his followers, and from the other pieces
which are contained in this volume. The second Egbert does
not occur here, or in the Durham History. In the Cotton
MS. Symeon's name is spelt with a y, as in his autograph copy
of the History of the Charch of Durham, in the University
Library in that city. In the Cambridge MS. it is written in
an abbreviated form with an z', thus, Sim'.

In the Cotton MS. the successors of Thurstan down to
George Neville‚ 1464-76, are added, not in their proper place
in the series of archbishopS, but at the end of the epistle, thus
giving us the date of the transcription.

V. History of St. Cutlzbert‚ and of such places and reqions
as belonyed to him of old, and down to tlze present time. The
latter part of the title, rather than the former, truly expresses
the object of this brief but very important contribution to the
history of the church of St. Cuthbert. The notices of the
Saint are incidental, and no particulars of his life, or details of
miracles wrought by him after his decease, are introduced
otherwise than in connection with the material advantages
which were derived from them. The work is referred to by
