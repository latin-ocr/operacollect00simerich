139, sm. folio, written in double column, soec. xii eceeunte.

I'r was given by archbishop Parker to the College.

The MS. contains at the commencement a rough list of its
contents, made in the fifteenth century, so that archbishop
Parker has not altered the position of any of the portions of
the volume, as he did in many other cases.

On the title are the following lines :-—-

“ Divitiis plena, genetrix quoque, Virgo serena,
Sint procu] obscaena mortis mihi, mater amaena.''
Below this are two short extracts from “Ge (nnad)ius Massiliensis
in libro de Illustribus Viris.’'

Foll. 2 a, 17 b. Rubrio. ‘⁶ Incipit Historia omnimoda '²

(cum bona chronica ejusdem).
Incipit. “ Mundum sine initio.”
Explicit. “Per lumen scientiae ad gloriam et honorem
perducat.’'
This consists of sacred and profane history in the shape of
notes, and a list of the PopeS.

Foll. 18 a, 36 b. Rubrio. “ Incipiunt Chronica abbatis
Prumiensis monasterii, ubi Lotharius imperator ad conver-
sionem venit.”

Incipit. “Anno imperii Octaviani Caesaris xlii.”
