PREFACE. xxxiii

In preparing this edition, it has been determined to omit all
that portion of the text which is taken from Florence of
Worcester, beyond such sentencesv or parts of sentences, and
passages, as are essentia] to render the additions intelligible.
A sufficient justification for this omission might be found in the
inexpediency of re-printing, without serving any object of
practica] utility, a mass of matter, many times exceeding in
bulk the contributions of Symeon, even if credit were given to
him for every word which is not directly copied from Florence,
It is, indeed, performing for Symeon, or whoever the inter-
polator may have been, the very operation which has been
successfully carried out for Florence himself, whose history, it
will be remembered, was originally grafted on Marianus Scotus,
just as our text has been grafted on him. But the advan-
tage is much more than negative. To retain the text of Flo-
rence is not only useless, but prejudicial. How often do we
find our best historians quoting his words as the testimony of
Symeon, and even insisting on the conclusive authority of
those words on Northern affairs, as proceeding from a Northern
source.

To ascertain what passages in the existing edition are really
due to the alleged author requires a minute collation with
Florence, to which few readers, and not many writers, will
submit, and of which the majority do not know the necessity.
In order to obviate all difficulty on this head, such portions of
Florence as have necessarily been retained in the present
edition are distinguished by inverted commaS, so that the
reader may distinguish the additional matter at a glance.

The same course might perhaps have been pursued with
regard to the abridgment of Asser, which forms so large a
proportion of the first part, but the cases are not precisely
similar. Our text affords one or two new readings of Asserst

α At p. 55 an important correction of the printed text is supplied. In the
MSS. of Asser we find “Emancestrz‘am, quod Brittanice dicitur Gairwiso, Latine
Civitas? the next word being deficient. This has been supplied from Florence,
who has Civitas Eme. Our text gives the true reading, Civitas Aquarum, which
is the Latin equivalent for the Saxon Exaneeastre, and the British Oairwisc.
