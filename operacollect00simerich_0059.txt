On the abolition of kingly government in Northumberland,
the administration was committed to a succession of earls,
some of whom presided over the whole district, whilst at other
times it was divided into two provinces. As regards the
country north of the Tyne, which had formed the kingdom of
the two Egberts and Ricsig, this form of government had
existed ever since the death of Guthred. The rulers, indeed,
were during the former period known as dukes, instead of
earls, but under both, as regarded the Northern province, the
government was hereditary in the same family. Ethelward
mentions the death of Eadulf, duke of Bamburgh, A.D. 912,
and he is spoken of in the Historia Cuthbertz' as the friend of
king Alfredst‘ In the same way his son Aldred is described as
the friend of king Edward,” and his name, Aldred of Bamburgh,
occurs in the pages of our general historians, amongst the petty
princes who did homage to Edward in 924, and to Athelstan in
926. Aldred had a brother Uchtred,⁰ a name of constant
recurrence, as is also that of his father Eadulf, amongst the
earls who succeeded to his power.

Of these earls we have two lists, both obviously derived
from the same authorities, amongst which the tract De

fourth year of Ethelred, the son of Eanred, A.D. 844, an event which has escaped
the notice of all our other historians, but which is confirmed by the existence of
coins bearing the name of the usurper, which have been found with others of the
same period at Hexham and elsewhere. Again, although in this tract, as well
as in the Historia Regum, we have the date of king Ricsig's death, Wendover
alone tells us that it was caused by distress of mind induced by the devastations
of Halfdene, who had overrun his kingdom, and parcelled out his lands amongst
his followerS. Again, we learn from the Historia Regum that Eiric, the last
Danish king of Northumberland, was slain by Maccus, the son of Anlaf.
Wendover gives much fuller particulars. Besides, supplying the date A.D. 750,
two years after Eiric’s expulsion, he informs us that he was slain through the
treachery of earl Osulf by Macon, the consul, with his son Henry and his brother
Reginald, in a solitary region called Stainmore. This Maccus, or Macon‚ lord
of Man and the Isles, the “arch-pirate '³ 'of Malmesbury, occurs twenty years
afterwards in the list of princes who performed an act of homage to king Edgar
on the river Dee, near Chester. Further instances of the exclusive information
preserved by WVendover will occur under the earls of Northumberland.
