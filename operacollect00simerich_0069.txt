PREFACE. lxiii

Besides the two Cambridge MSS. he used otherS, which will
be described in the second volume, on the History of the Churcli
of Barbam, but none as regards the works in the present

volume.
In 1732 an admirable edition of the History of tlze Churcli

of Darkam, which we have previously had occasion to notice
in connection with Rudd's reply to Selden which is prefixed to
it, was published by Dr. Bedford in a small octavo volume.
This edition is based on a MS. now in the Library of the
University of Durham, which was unknown to Twysden and
Selden, and which will be fully described in the Preface to the
second volume.

The only other portion of any of the reputed works of
Symeon which has hitherto been published is contained in the
solitary volume of the Monumenta Historica Britannica. This

is limited to the First Part of the Historia Reyum, with such ι

portions of the original matter in the second part as refer to
the period antecedent to the Norman Conquest. Of the merits
of this publication under the editorship of the late Mr. Petrie,
it is unnecessary to speak, but it contains only a small portion
of the works of Symeon, and is incorporated in a volume of
colossal size.

Seeing, then, that the text of the Decem Scriptores is
capable of considerable amendment, and is unaccompanied by
such explanatory notes and elucidations as historica] readers
are accustomed to meet with, the Council of the Surtees
Society resolved to place the Worlcs of Symeon of Durham on
their list of intended publicatione.

To this resolution the existence of a small portion of one
of the works in the Monumenta Britannica constituted no
obj ection, but it was doubtful whether the existence of Bedford’s
edition might not render it expedient to exclude the History of
the Cliurclz of Darkam from the proposed publication. The
increasing scarcity of that volume, and the growing demand
for works of this class, tends year by year to diniinish any
hesitation which might exist on the subject, but it has been
determined in the first instance to confine the publication to
