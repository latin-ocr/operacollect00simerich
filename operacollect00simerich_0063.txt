PREFACE. i lvii

Diu-ham. Of these it has for the most part been considered
sufficient to give the title and initial line. They would have
been omitted altogether, but for their connection with the
publication of the Translatz'ons of St. Cuthbert, with Which, as
we have seen, they have been mixed up. The portion which
has been mistaken for· the conclusion of the Translations, com-
mences with the word “ tenera '² at the bottom of p. 226.
The last chapter, which contains an enumeration of the pos-
sessions of the church founded at Lindisfarne, and ultimately
established at Durham, is printed entire for the purpose of
comparison with other documents of the same class, none of
which altogether correspond.

Of the MSS. which contain the Translatz'ons· of St. Cuthbert,
four also contain this Relati0n; MSS. Nero and Titus in the
Cottonian Library, Laud in the Bodleian, and Gale in that of
Trinity College, Cambridge, all which have been examined for
the present edition. Mr. Hardy refers to another, MS. Sloane,
17 72, vellum, quarto, twelfth century.

APPENDIX, No. ΠΙ. L‘efe of Λάαν-φανεῖ Quem of Scotlcmd,
attributed to Turgot, Prior of Durham. It has been thought
desirable to bring together in this collection everything which
has been ascribed to the pen of Turgot, as bearing upon the

of Durham.
⁶ Of the Life of Queen Margaret but one copy exists in manu-
script in this kingdom, in a folio volume on vellum, in double
columns, of the latter part of the twelfth century, Cotton, Tibe-
rius, D. iii„ which was much injured by the great fire in the
British Museum. It was long supposed to have been rendered
altogether useless for the purpose of reference, but has been
repaired and restored so successfully, that, with comparatively
trifling exceptions, where the tops of the leaves have been con-
sumed, the whole of the contents can be decyphered by painful
study.

It contains a collection of the Lives of British Saints, in
Α which the Life of St. Margaret immediately follows the Legend
of the “ Passion of the holy martyrs, Primus and Felicianus,’'
