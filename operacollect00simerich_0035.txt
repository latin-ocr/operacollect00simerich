PREFACE. xxix

Earl Gospatric, who retaliated ΒΥ making a raid upon Malcolm's
Cumbrian territorias, and the mutual exasperationis represented
as extreme. All this, unsupported by other testimony, appears
little entitled to credit, when opposed not only to the general
statements which we have from all quarters of the amity which
existed between the two, but more especially to the fact that .
when Gospatric was shortly afterwards driven from his earldom,
he took refuge at the Scottish court, where he was not only
hospitably received, but was replaced in his adopted country in
a position, both as to rank and estate, little inferior to that which
he had held in the land of his birth. We can imagine Malcolm
ignoring obligations and violating pledges ,- we can even believe
that circumstances might induce him to be reconciled to a for-
mer foe, but it is difficult to account for the bestowal of the
wealth and honours which he heaped upon Gospatric, after the
mutual injuries which they are here said to have inflicted on
each other. There are minor discrepancies and inconsistencies
in reference to this invasion which it is difficult to reconcile with
known facts, and which at all events prove that the account
could not have been written by Symeon. The church of St.
Peter at Wearmouth is represented as having been burnt down
on this occasion,²‘ whereas we lcarn from Symeon that it had
been for ages in ruins, its walls only standing, and the site, both
within and without, overgrown by timber and brushwood, which
were cut down with much labour a few years later, when the
edifice was at last put into a state of repair.²⁷ The accounts of
Malcolm's atrocities so closely resemble those ascribed to his
son David Ι. ΒΥ the Hexham historianS, that, knowing as we do
that the former portion of this work had received interpolations
from a Hexham pen, it is difficult to resist the conviction that
the details now under review have been additions from the same
