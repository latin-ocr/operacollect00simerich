PREFACE. xi

Romsey about the year 990.η This narrative is repeated nearly
verbatim in the Life of Mildreda, which passes under the
name of that writer, and is printed in an abbreviated form by
Capgrave.

ΙΙ. The Succession of the Kinys of Nortlzumberland is also
treated in the MS. as part of the History of the Kings of the
Angles and Danes, and is connected with the Passion of St.
Ethelbert and St. Ethelred by the following sentence : “ In the
beginning of this work I have accurately set forth the succes-
sion of the Kentish kings: I must now set forth that of the
kings of the NorthumbrianS, that we may come to the times
of those of whom there 18 no history, after the death of the
venerable priest, Beda.'’ This piece is merely a paraphrase, in
very inflated language, of the short Northumbrian chronology
which 18 appended to many MSS. of Beda's Ecclesiastical
History.

If the version is by Symeon, it was probably executed in
very early life, before his judgment was matured. The phrase-
ology is evidently adopted in imitation of that in which the
preceding legend is written, and is even more laboured and
ambitious in its style. Its value as an authority is of course
nullified by the existence of the original document from which
it is paraphrased; but it is of some interest in consequence of
the similarity of its style to that of a version of Asser’s Life of
Alfred, which is incorporated with the first part of the History
of the Kinys, which points to the inference that both are from
the same hand, that if one, then both have been operated
upon by Symeon 3 and that the Kentish legend from which the
phraseology is derived, in which both are clothed, must have
formed part of the collections of the same writer. The question
of the authorship, however, will be more satisfactorily dis-
cussed in connection with the more important work which
immediately follows.
