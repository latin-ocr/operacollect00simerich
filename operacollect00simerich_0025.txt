PRE FACE. xix

The , anonymous author of the work for the first time made
public in this volume, De Adventu Saxonum, has used the
same materials up to this date in the Northumbrian portion of
his compilation, and they must even have existed in the time
of Roger of Wendover, a much more recent author, whose
narrative precisely agrees with Symeon's, but is occasionally
somewhat fuller in details.

We have traces also of a continuation of the Historia de
Gestis Regum Anyloruâ€˜m, which is probably the same that is
cited by Adam of Bremen, an author referred to by Dr. Lap-
penbergh, under the title of Gesta Anytorum, as his authority
for events which occurred half a century later, and which we
do not find recorded by any other historian. This continuation
was probably not the work of a contemporary, nor is it probable
that there ever existed a complete and continuous history of the
affairs of Northumberland during the troublous period which
intervened between the reign of Ricsig and that of Eric, or
Hyric, the last of her Danish rulers. For the earlier portion
of this interval there are no other details in the History of the
Church of Durham than are to be met with in the ancient
History of St. Cuthbert: those in the Libellus de Adventu
Saxonum are probably from the Gesta Anglorum, and contain
little which is not to be found in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

The importance of the early annals embodied in the Historia
de Gestis Reyam Anyloram et Dacorum has been greatly un-
derrated, in consequence of their having been looked upon as
the production of an author of the twelfth century, instead of
being, as they unquestionably are, the genuine records of the
eighth and ninth 3 as ancient and authentic as any of the
materials which have been incorporated in the Saxon Chronicle
for the same period.

The original information which they supply relates more
particularly to the kingdom of Northumberland, but is by no
means confined to it. The following notices apply to the his-
tory of the southern 813108. Under the year 732 we read of
the death of Alrio, one of the sons and co-heirs of VVictred,
king of Kent, which is unnoticed in the Saxon Chronicle, and
