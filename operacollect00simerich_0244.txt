rum AEthelredo, Malcolmus rex Scottorum, filius Kynedi regis,
congregato totius Scotiae exercitu, provinciam Northanhumbro-

Waltheof, qui comes fuerat Northanimbrorum, sese in Beebban-

hostes nihil virtutis facere poterat. Cujus filio, scilicet Ucth-

υ This date is corrupt3 the foundations of Durham were not laid till nearly
thirty years later. Ethelred did not succeed to the crown of England till
ΑΛ). 978, nor Malcolm to that of Scotland till 1003 : Aldune's episcopacy did not
commence till ΑΛ). 990. The year 969 is probably written in mistake for- 999.
Even that date was four years before Malcolm’s accession to the Scottish throne,
but he was already king of Cumbria, and tanist of Scotland, in which capacity
he probably commanded the forces of the latter kingdom at the siege of Durham.
It is remarkable that we find no notice of this siege in Symeon’s History of the
Church of Durham. In that work Uchtred is mentioned as earl of Northum-
bei-land as early as A.D. 997, when he assisted the bishop in clearing the site of
his future city. Probably the title by which he was asterwards known is given
him for distinction's sake by anticipation ; as the foundation of the city must at
all events have preceded the date of the siege, when the earldom was still held by
the aged Waltheof. ,
