from his own lips The author of the compilation before us copies Symeon's
narrative verbatim, giving as his authority the testimony of the same party,
from whom, however, he does not say that he had himself heard it, but that
very many had heard it, thus confirming the impression which we derive from
the perusa] of the compilation throughout, that the author epitomized Symeon
at no very great interval, when some of the very many auditors of the second-
sighted monk were still alive to testify to the accuraey of the report of his
narrative.

‘1 Section xxxvii. of the printed copies. Two other sections occur in the
printed text, viz.‚ section xxxviii.‚ which forms the seventh section of our MSS.
of the Liber de Translationibus, p. 172 of this volume3 and section xxxix„ which
forms the third chapter of the third book of Symeon's History of the Chureh
of Durham. Symeon relates the miraele on the authority of certain religious
and aged priests from whom he had repeatedly heard it. In the printed text his
statement on this head is adopted without alteration.
