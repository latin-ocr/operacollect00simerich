Χ PREFACE.

render its publication highly expedient in connection with the
other pieces in this volume.

Another tract has been printed by Twysden, consisting of
various historica] and topographical extractS, which have been
inserted in the MS. of the History of the Church of Durham
which is preserved in the Cambridge University Library. They
bear internal evidence of having been thrown together by the
transcriber in the reign of Henry ΙΙ., and not by Symeon in
that of Henry I. As, however, they have been so long asso-
ciated with his name, they are printed in the Appendix.

The present volume thus contains everyt'hing which has at
any time been ascribed to the authorship of Symeon, with the
exception, already noticed, of his History of the Church of
Durham. This has been reserved for future publication, with
such kindred and illustrative matter, as, taken in conjunction
with the previous volumes of the Surtees Society, will exhaust
the ancient literature connected with the Life of St. Cuthbert,
and the history of his church.

Having explained the scope of the present undertaking, it
remains to lay before the reader a more detailed account of the
contents of the volume now presented, and of the MSS. from
which they have beon derived.

being indeed described as part of that work, and placed after
the rubric to which reference has already been made. On the
ground that it may have been copied from the collections of
Symeon it is printed here, but it certainly has no connection
with the History of the Kinys, which is confined, on the testi-
mony of the rubric itself, to transactions “ after the death of
the Venerable Beda.’' The legend has moreover an appropriate
rubric of its own. We have no information as to the name of
the author, but we have distinct proof that it was written long
before the age of Symeon. The legend informs us that the
bodies of the martyred princes were still deposited at Wakering,
whereas we know from Gotscelin that they were removed to
