Malmesbury, are in various hands. The poem of Beda is full of
interlineations, other words being inserted with the word vel
before them. The word vel occurs in other places throughout the
first part of the MS„ shewing that it was regarded as subject to
correction. There are also many interpolations (given between
the lines), not noticed as such in the printed text, which have
evidently been done by a north country hand. I regard the
greater part of this as Symeon’s own notes and extracts, out of
which the chronicle from 848 downwards was constructed and
perhaps designed to be extended upwards. The scribe found
them with the completed portion (i. e. from 848 downwards),
and copied the whole. He has shewn his estimate of Part
No. 2, by copying it carefully and neatly. The First Part 116
has treated as a set of Notes, as he found it. Even the chrono-
logical part is carelessly written, and he has probably added
largely to the whole, intending perhaps to make something
orderly of it. He probably inserted the accounts of Acca
and Alchmund, and secured copies of the Passion of Ethel-
bert, etc.

lee Recapz'tulatz'o begins in 848 (Twysden, col. 137), with a
carefully made letter in green and red, evidently intended to
mark the commencement of a work. It is carefully and neatly
written throughout in the same set and orderly hand which
wrote foll. 37-52, and which goes on afterwards. In this part
there are occasional erasures, and words put between the lines,
or in the margin, or at the foot of the page.

Of these the greater number, especially the marginal re-
ferences relating to northern bishops and persons, are in a coarse
hand, which appear in other parts of the MS„ i. e. in Part No. l,
John of Hexham, and the account of St. Mary’s abbey, and
especially in Nennius. The references, etc., to the archbishops
of York, the bishops of Hexham, Chester and Lindisfarne, are
all of them in this hand. The erasures relate generally to
northern matters. The writing is probably very early thirteenth
century, if not somewhat earlier. The remainder of the mar-
ginal references are by the scribe himself, and are in a small
neat hand.
