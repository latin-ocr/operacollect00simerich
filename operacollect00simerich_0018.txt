xii PREFACE.

III. History of tlte Kinys of the Anyles and Danes. The
only ancient copy of this compilation is contained in a MS.
volume in the library of C. C. College, Cambridge,⁰ formerly
in the possession of Archbishop Parker, of which a minute
description will be found in the appendix to this Preface, being
the result of a careful examination and collation by the
Rev. J ames Raine. Besides the two pieces which precede the
History of tlze Kinys in the present volume, there are in the
MS„ interposed between the rubric and the body of the work,
many pages of extracts from the writings of Beda, including a
large portion of the Lives of the Abbats of Jarrow and Wear-
mouth, with several Latin poems, one of them of considerable
length. As all these are accessible in the collected editions of
Beda's works, it has not been thought necessary to reproduce
them here, especially as they exhibit no marks of that manipu-
lation to which the Northumbrian chronicle and the version of
Asser have been subjected.

The rubric is to the following effect :—“ Here begins the
History of Symeon of holy and sweet memory, monk and
precentor of the Church of Durham, concerning the deeds of
the kings of the Anglcs and DaneS, and their incessant wars,
rapines, and incendiarisms3 from the death of the Venerable
priest Beda, nearly to the death of King Henry L, the son of
William the Bastard, who conquered England, that is, for a
period of four hundred and twenty-nine years and four months.'’

The inaccuracy of the computation in the last line has been
already pointed out, but the rubrio altogether is very little to
be depended upon, and certainly formed no part of the original
work, but must have been added not earlier than the reign of
Henry IL, previous to whose accession there was no occasion
to distinguish his predecessor of the same name, as Henry I.
To all the matter previously adverted to it is altogether inap-
plicable, as the whole of it relates to a period inconsistent with
the title, for the most part antecedent to the birth of Beda, and
in no case posterior to his death. Leland, who has made
