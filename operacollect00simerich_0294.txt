and this appears to be accidental. In all cases it is pointed out in the notes. On
the other hand, the Magdalen MS. furnishes several readings, which restore
sense to vitiated passages which are quite unintelligible in MS. Caligula.

With regard to the spelling of names beginning with Ea and Eo in O„ as
Eathelbert, Eorconbert, M. has very generally AE and (Ε, sometimes A or E,
as Athelred and Elfleda for Eathelred and Ealfieda in C. In such names as
Eathelbert, again, M. has very generally d for th, but not invariably, even when
the same name recurs within a few lines. VVords beginning with Ey in C. are
frequently written qu in M„ as qubert or Ecybrioht for Egbert. In Suthseaxa,
Westseaxa, and similar words, in the middle of which ea occur in conj unction, a
18 generally omitted in M. In spelling words such as Kinewulf, Ethelwulf, etc„
C. generally employs ωτι, M. generally w only, but the practice of neither is
uniform. In this section Oisic in M. is Orsic in C.; and in this sect-ion, and
generally throughout, Cantia in M. is Cancia in C. As regards the differenoe of
numerals, the reign of Eathelbert in this section is 24 years in C., 23 years in M.
The reign of Hengist in M. is 23 years.

θ Wallingford copies the Kentish genealogy to this point.

f The Magdalen MS. has no rubrio here. In MS. Caligula, Saxonum is
written instead of Anylorwm, and the genealogies of East Anglia and Essex are
both placed under it without any separation, >and are so copied by Wallingford.
Reodwald 18 written by mistake Trodwald in MS. Caligula, and is corrected from
MS. Magd. The latter has Eogric for Egrio, AEdheldridae for Etheldritlzae,

AEthelwold for Eathelwold, Edmundus for Eadmundus, Guthum for Guthun,
AEdelstano for Aethelstano.
