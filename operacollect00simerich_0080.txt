note, in reference to the claims of Monkton :——“ Erat autem
territorii Gyrwensis haud grandi oriundus viculo. Non longe
inde lapsurus in oceanum amnis Tina praeterfluit.” The
date of the historian's birth is given as 677.

Tract No. 5, Beda's Lives of the Abbats. See above.

No. 6, p. 235. A MS. of NenniuS. See Rudd, who
ascribes it to the commencement of the twelfth century, vide
Hardy’s Catalogue, i., 325. It is Stevenson's N„ and Petrie's
C.; Hardy gives it to cent. 12, Stevenson to cent. 13. My
examination not relating to it specially, I speak with deference,
but to my eye it seemed earlier than the documents of the time
of bishop Pudsey, to which my attention was directed.

Notwithstanding Stevenson's note, xxviii., the MS. requires
careful collation. It has not the genealogieS, and, in some
respects, may not be of a high order, but its northern cha-
racter deserves attention. It has the miracles,

In Arthur’s battles the MS. reads Glem, or Glein: Duglas z
Bassas: Callidonis: Guinonthibroit.

At the end of Stevenson'S, ᾧ 56, the MS. proceeds thus :—

“ Usque ad tempus quo Ida regnavit, qui fuit filius Eobba,
ipse primus [fuit rex added in a hand contemporary, or nearly
80]. Prima civitas Britanniae ipsa in Beornicama est quae
vocatur Oair Guortlci9i7·n.” Then the remaining twenty-five
cities are enumerated thus :-—-

Cair Muncip, Cair Meiguod, Cair Ebroauc, Cair Caratauc,
Cair Mauchguid, Cair Caint, Cair Peris, Cair Legion, Cair
Legeint, Cair Guent, Cair Lerion, Cair Pensa vel Coit, Cair
Guintiug, Cair Lualid, Cair Colum, Cair Custeint, Cair Grauth,
Cair Lunden, Cair Guoricon, Cair Legion Guar iuuc, Cair Brito,
Cair Drotchoi, Cair Urnach, Cair Celeimon, Cair Luit Coit.

Then comes what stands in Stevenson as the preceding
sentence, “ Haec sunt nomina,'' etc.

 

α This mark σι refers to a separate slip bound into the MS. of much the
sanie date, beginning “ Ida filius Eobba tenuit regiones, etc„ arcem,'' etc„ as in
Stevenson's note 14, on his p. 52. After all, whether the copyist did not
thoroughly misunderstand his original, and whether “in Beornioffl does not
properly belong to the “ fuit rex ⁷³ of his int-erlincation.
