xl PREFACE.

decease of Ranulph Archbishop of Canterbury‚t which occurred
in 1122. The first four chapters are derived from the History
of St. Cuthbert, and are all of them adopted or referred to by
Symeon. The first contains the vision of King Alfred3 the
second the miracle of the three bloody waves, the third the
legend of Onalafball, or, as his name is here spelt, Onalafbald 3
the fourth is the history of the destruction of the Scottish host
in the reign of Gruthred. To all these Symeon, doubtless, had
access in the pages of the earlier authority 3 but the fifth and
sixth are not to be found there, but first occur in the present
work. The fifth chapter records the punishment of Barcwith
or Barcwid, a soldier of Earl Tosti, for a violation of the sanc-
tity of the monastic precincts, to which Symeon specially refers,
as it is “elsewhere detailed more fullyss’u The sixth chapter
contains a relation, adopted by Symeon, of the miraculous
interposition, by which the monks were enabled to pass the
sands between the mainland of Northumberland and the island
of Lindisfarne at high tide, when they fied with the body of the
Saint to escape the anger of William the Conqueror after the
slaughter of Robert Cumin and his men at Durham.²⁷ The
seventh chapter, which forms chapter xviii. of the work as it
now stands, is the most interesting of the whole, containing a
minute and circumstantia] account of the exhumation of the
body of St. Cuthbert‚ A.D. 1104. This is found in all existing
MSS. of the Translations of St. Cuthbert, to which indeed it
gives name, the bulk of the remainder of the work being taken
up with a series of miracles, which although due to the inter-
,position of the Saint, are only occasionally connected with the
migrations of his remains. It is printed separately in the Acta
Sanctorum, and a translation is given by the late Dr. Raine in
his St. Cuthbert, pp. 75-78.

The eleven intervening chapters, vii. to xvii. inclusive, occur
in all the MSS. with the exception noted above 3 chapters xix.
and xx. are in the Laud, Arundel, and Gale MSS„ xxi. in
Arundel and Gale only.
