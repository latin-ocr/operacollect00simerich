name contrasted with other ancient authoritieS, in note 9,
p. 9, of this volume.

From Ethelfrith to Ceolwulf, Beda and the ancient North-
umbrian chronology appended to his works are the authorities
followed. The ancient annals which are incorporated in the
Historia Reyam Anytorum are then taken up, and form the
basis of the narrative, not merely to the period where they
abruptly cease in the Historia Reyum A.D. 802, but as far as
they are used by Symeon in the Historia Danelmensis to the
reign of Ricsig A.1>.873-6. The· length of this king's reign,
which is not given in that work, is here stated to have been
three yearS, which is also the term assigned to him in the
second part of the Historia Reyum. There is an apparent dis-
crepancy between the two authorities as to the reign of his
successor, Egbert II„ who is here said to have reigned two
years,9 i. e., to the year 878. In the second part of the Historia
Reyam he is spoken of as if he were still alive on the accession
of (}uthred to the throne of the southern province, as there
stated, A.D. 883. The words are, Regyrzavit (Gutlzredus) saper
Eboracum ,· Eybert vero saper Northimbros. The sense, how-
ever, in which they were intended to be used might merely be,
Guthred had the seat of his government at York, (whereas)
Egbert only reigned over the Northumbrians (beyond the
Tyne). Our authority, again, gives to Guthred a reign of
fourteen years, whereas the Historia Reyum places his death
A.D. 894 ,- but Ethelwerd, a much earlier and better authority,
mentions his death and burial at York two years later, A.D. 896,
which would be in the fourteenth year of his reign 5 or, if we
compute it from the death of his predecessor, Halfdene, we
have fourteen years complete. The following table of North-
umbrian chronology, from the slaughter of the two kings,
Osbert and Ella, A.D. 867, to the death of Guthred, is com-
piled from the several works in this volume, with the above
correction from Ethelwerd 2——
