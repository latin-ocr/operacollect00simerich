PREFACE. xliii

claim, and it has been thought desirable to give a place to it
in the Appendix, divested of those details which are copied ver-
batim from Symeon. It has thus been compressed within a
moderate space, whilst as ample an opportunity is afforded of
referring to it in connection with the matters before us as if it
had been printed in eoetenSO.

The MSS. from Which our text has been formed are

1. MS. Harl. 1924, a small quarto on vellum of the twelfth
century. This manuscript contains only the first six chapters,
and the eighteenth.

2. MS. Cotton, Nero A. ii., also on vellum, of the twelfth
century, in duodecimo, ends abruptly in the middle of chapter
xviii„ but it contains, besides, the Relatio de Sancto Cuthberto.

3. MS. BodL, Laud 491, a small thick quarto volume with
some rich illustrations, written between 1160 and 11863 in
single columns 3 a very fine MS„ belonging originally to “ Leo
Pylkynton,'' prebendary of Durham, whose autograph it bears.
It contains Beda’s Life of St. Cuthbert, after which is a rubric
“Explicit liber de Vita et Miraculis beatissimi patris,'' etc.
Then come two chapters of St. Cuthbert's miracles from Beda's
Ecclesiastical History (i., 31, 32), which also precede the Trans-
latz'ons in the two former MSS. The Liber de Translatiom'bus
extends to twenty Chapters, and is followed by the Relatio. The
text of this MS. is more correct than that of either of the
preceding, but they very nearly coincide in those chapters
which they have in common.

4. MS. Arundel 332, a very fine MS. on vellum, of the thir-
teenth century, in octavo, agrees generally with the foregoing,
but has one additional miracle, which forms ehapterxxxi. of the
present edition.

5. MS. Gale, O. iii., 55, a volume which has been very
kindly entrusted to the care of the Society by the Master and
Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge. It contains the twenty
chapters, and is a MS. of great value and antiquity, having
probably been written at Durham in the twelfth century. It
subsequently belonged to the Priory of Holy Island. A full de-
’ scription of this MS. is given in the Appendix to the Preface.
