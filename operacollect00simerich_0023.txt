5. The account given in this work of the attack of the Danes
on the monastery at the mouth of the Don is copied verbatim
in the History of the Church of Durham, but in the latter we
have an explanation, which was unnecessary in the time of the
earlier writer, that Portus Ecyfrz'dz' was the old name of the
estuary at J arrow at the confluence of the Don with the Tyne.²⁰

The number of cases of this kind, of the recurrence of
combinations of words which would never spontaneously have ,
presented themselves to two independent writers, might be
extended, but the above are the most remarkable. We must
not, however, omit to point out one very notable instance in
which Symeon has unquestionably derived his materials from
the Historia de Gestis Regum, but has assigned motives for the
acts detailed, which cannot be gathered from the earlier writer,
and are even opposed to the obvious deductions from his text,
thus clearly demonstrating that Symeon was not the author of
these annals, inasmuch as he was not in all cases able to unravel
the intricacies of their narrative. Under the year 750 we read
that King Eadbert led Bishop Kynewlf captive to Bamburgh,
and afterwards confined him in the church of St. Peter at
Lindisfarne. Also that Offa, the son of Aldfrid, although
innocent, was compelled to take refuge at the shrine of St.
Cuthbert, but was dragged, unarmed and almost dead with
hunger, from the church.'⁶

The natural inference seems to be that both acts of violence
were committed by the king, or with his sanction, but Symeon
gives quite a different version, attributing the calamities which
befell Offa, in general terms, to the persecution of his enemies,
and the punishment of the bishop to Eadbert's displeasure at
his connivance or non-interference to prevent such atrocities.
Even if the text before us admitted of such an interpretation,
we have this serious difficulty to contend with, that Offa so far
