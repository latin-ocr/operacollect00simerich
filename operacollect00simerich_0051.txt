series, This MS. has been largely used by the northern his-
torical writers. It is a small delicately finished volume in a
hand of the twelfth century, with many interesting illuminations.
Mr. Longstaffe suggests that these Chapters, which were not
known to him under any distinguishing title, may have been
the work of Symeon written previous to the History of the
Church of Durham, and afterwards freely drawn upon as mate-
rials for his more ambitious volume. The same idea has occurred
to Mr. Hardy, who offers also an alternative theory, that, if
Turgot did write anything relative to the church of St. Cuth-
bert, this may have been his work. Either hypothesis is worthy
of consideration, with this limitation, that Turgot’s connection
with the work can only have extended to the first six chapters,
as the eighteenth chapter, which was originally the seventh,
must, as has been already explained, have been written after
his death. Symeon, on the other hand, was as well qualified as
Turgot to have described the circumstances detailed in the
eighteenth chapter, which relate to the disinterment of St.
Cuthbert's remains, at which ceremony both were present, whilst
the former only was alive at the date when the narrative was
composed.—The intermediate chapters between the sixth and
the eighteenth could scarcely have been written by, or even
known to Symeon, or he would have made use of them, as he
has of those which precede them, whenever they come within
the period to which his history is limited.

¹ Kinys. In noticing the Abbrevz'atio Symeonis, attention has

already been directed to this little work, which is prefixed to it
in the only MS. of that abridgment which is known to existf*
in which both are jointly attributed to Symeon of Durham.
We have, however, ample ground for treating this Anglo-Saxon
history as a separate production, entirely distinct from the
Abbrevz'atio, of which it is unnecessary to speak farther in this
place. Of the Anglo-Saxon History we have three copies in
which it stands unconnected with any other work. These are
