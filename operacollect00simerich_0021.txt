unimportant additionS, and some scanty notices by way of con-
tinuation, the last of which refers to the year 957.

The first division, although it professes to take up the
Anglo-Saxon annals from the death of Beda, really commences
where his Ecclesiastical History endS, three years earlier. The
last chapter of Beda contains, as is well known, what is called
a Recapitulatzbn of the whole work, but which is in fact a
’ chronological summary of the affairs of Britain, founded for
the most part on the previous narrative, but containing some
information of considerable importance which does not occur
theres

This summary is continued up to and after the death of the
author in various existing MSS. for a longer or shorter period.
In some it ends with A.D. 7 35 3 in others it is carried on to 766,
and the chronicle under consideration to a very great extent,
though not uniformly, coincides with it up to the later date,
differing from it only in the same degree that one copy of the
Saxon Chronicle differs from another. From 766 to the com-
mencement of the following century it is of precisely the same
character, being to all appearance a series of notes committed
to writing whilst the events were fresh in· the memory of the
authors. We have evidence, at all eventS, that it was compiled
previous to the year of Halfdene’s incursion, 87 5 , in which the
church of Hexham was destroyed. In an entry under A.D. 788
the author describes it as still existing in his own time, as it
stood at the date referred to, in all its pristine splendour 3
whereas we know that the torches of Halfdene's followers had
consumed the woodwork and ornamental fittingS, and left
nothing but the wreck of its bare and blackened walls.

The copy of these annals in the work before us ends
abruptly and imperfectly, the entry under the year 803 break-
ing off in the middle of a sentence. From this year to 830 is
a total blank 3 then occurs one of a series of notices of the suc-

r Inter alia, the notice of the foundation of the kingdom of Northumberland
by Ida, which has been copied in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and. by all our
early historians, is found in the “Recapitulati0” only: the very name of Ida
does not occur in the body of the Ecclesiastical History.
