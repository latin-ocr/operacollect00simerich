PREFACE. lv

bona fides of the narrative of this transaction, written, be it
remembered, at a period long prior to any dispute as to the
relations between England and Scotland. On the other hand,
it is not difficult to account for the author of the Historia
Reyum not merely omitting this incident, but leaving out the
name of Eadulf Yvilcild altogether, under the impression that
his authority had confounded it with that of Eadulf Cudel, to
whom the cession of Lothian is imputed by another authority,
the tract De Obsessione Dimelmi.

There is in fact no inconsistency between the two state-
ments. Nothing is more probable than that the province now
ceded was reclaimed by Uchtred, the most powerful of all the
Northumbrian earIS, and was again wrested from the grasp of
his unwarlike brother and successor Eadulf Cudel. Some
particulars occur in the Historia Requm which are not in the
Libellus, but these are generally to be found in the tract De
Obsessione Dunelmi, with the except-ion of the account of the
death of Eadulf Rus, the assassin of bishop Walcher, by the
hands of a woman, his burial at J edburgh 3 and the subsequent
disturbance of his remains by prior Turgot.
