XXX PREFACE.

our historianS, rests on the solitary authority of this interpola-
tion. The tale of the meeting of Malcolm with his future queen
and her brother and sister at Wearmouth is not merely an idle
fable unsupported by other evidence, but it is dated two years
after the settlement of all the parties in Scotland. Some of
θ the interpolations undoubtedly contain genuine information‚
but not always on matters of very great importance 3 and the
examples which have been here given are sufficient to point out
that they must not in all cases be received without examination.
It has been further shewn that a large portion, at all events, is
not due to Symeon. Indeed the rubric 18 the only evidence we
possess that he had any connection with the work at all, and
this assigns to him the authorship of the first part as well as
the second. As regards the first part, he appears at most to
have been only the transcriber of the MS. of an anonymous
collector of the time of Edward the Confessor, just as he had
transcribed the Historia Cutlzbertz· and the tract on the Sieye of
Darkam, as materials for his own works. In the same way it is
probable that, on the appearance of Florence of WVorcester’s
chronicle, he may have made an abridgment of it, adding to it
perhaps from year to year such notices of current events as
ultimately formed the continuation as we now have it. Some
of the interpolations may also have been his. This is indeed,
to a great extent, matter of speculation, but it is as near an
approach to certainty as with the limited and somewhat con-
tradictory information in our possession we are ever likely to
arrive at.

The last entry in this chronicle refers to the year 1129,
which is perfectly consistent with Symeon's age, and with the
assumption that the continuation proceeded from 1118 pen. In
endeavouring to fix the precise date of its completion‚ our
attention is naturally directed to two lists of the abbats of the
religious houses founded at York and Whitby, which are in-
troduced in connection with the account of the re-introduction
of monastic institutions into Northumberland A.D. 1074, nearly
two centuries after their extermination by the Danesss A com-
