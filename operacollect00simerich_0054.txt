xlviii PREFACE.

down. We are thus enabled to determine its date to within a
year. Stephen, we are told, continued to hold the earldom of
Northumberland in his own hands, as his predecessors William
II. and Henry had done before him. This could not have been
written later than Aa), 1139, in which year the earldom was
once more severed from the crown of England, and conferred
on Henry, son of David, king of Scotland: neither could it
have been written earlier than the previous year, 1138, in which
Geoffrey Rufus, who occurs as bishop of Durham, was appointed
to that see.

The only additional particulars supplied by this MS. relate
to Robert de Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, who, in oppo-
sition to other authorities, is said to have ended his life in the
monastery of St. Albans, to which he had been a munificent
benefactor. From this intimation we may conjecture that this
transeript was made either at Tynemouth, a cell of St. Albans
founded by this earl Robert, or at the parent establishment.

That the monks of St. Albans were in possession of a copy
is unquestionable, as it has been used extensively by historians
connected with their house. The series of the earlier kings of
the heptarchy, as given by Wallingford, is copied verbatim from
this source,f and many subsequent notices are derived from it.
Several remarkable instances will also be pointed out of the
obligations of Roger de Wendover, who stands at the head of
the great chroniclers of St. Albans, to this work.

The arrangement to the end of the fourth section is the
same as in MS. Caligula, but no rubrics are prefixed to the
accounts of the kings of Kent and East Anglia. The later
sections follow in the following order 2——

5. Archbishops of Canterbury and York.
6. Kings of Mercia.

7. Kings of Essex.

8. Bishops of Durham.

9. Kings of Wessex.

10. Kings of Bernicia and Northumberland.

f The termination of WVallingford’s series of the kings of the heptarchy
is pointed out in the notes as regards each state.
