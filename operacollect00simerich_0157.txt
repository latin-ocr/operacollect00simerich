‘¹ The words, “ de Historia Willelmi Malmesbiriae,” are here added in red
ink in the MS„ but do not apply to the “Recapitulatio,” or the “ Successio
Regum,” which are derived mainly from Florence of Worcester, and in no part
from the Historia of Malmesbury, but to certain extracts from the latter, which
have been interpolated in a hand somewhat more recent than the text. These
extracts have been omitted, but may be consulted in the original by the aid of
the following references to the edition of William of Malmesbury, published by
the English Historical Society under the editorship of Mr. Duffus Hardy :—

Ι. Vision of King Edgar, book ii„ sections 154, 155 ; vol. 1., pp. 248-251.
II. Vision of Bishop Brihtwold, book ii„ section 221 3 vol. 1., pp. 374-37 5.
III. Prodigy significant of the union of England and Normandy, book ii.³ sect.
2073 vol. i.‚ p. 358.
IV. Vision of Edward the Confessor, book ii„ section 2263 vol. i.‚ pp. 380-381.
⁶ The initial A is an illuminated letter in green and gold in the MS.

⁶ Here follows a genealogy similar 10 that at pp. 42-3, taken from Florence of
Worcester. For reasons assigned in the Preface, it has not been considered
necessary to reprint any portion of the “ Recapitulatio,” which is copied either
from Asser, as paraphrased in the former part of the present work, or from Florence
of Worcester, or any portion of the “ Successio Regum,²’ which is derived from
Florence, except in cases where it is intermixed with additions from other sources,
which would not be intelligible without it. Such extracts from Asser and

FlozerZJe alre distinguished by inverted commas.
