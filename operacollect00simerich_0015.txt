PREFACE. ix

the History of the Kinys of the Anyles and Danes. The last-
mentioned productiori occupies an intermediate position between
an original composition and a mere transcript, being for the
most part a verbatim copy or an abridgment of earlier writers»,
with certain additions, some of which are possibly from the
pen of Symeon, whilst others have unquestionably been added
by a later hand.

In order to include all these pieces, the title of Symeom's
Opera et Collectanea has been adopted for the present publi-
cation. Under the latter designation a place has also been
reserved for the very important History of the Miracles and
Translatz'ons of St. Cuthbert, of which no perfect copy has
previously been printed, and which, although it has not
hitherto, like his other Collectanea, been associated with his
name, has yet been used by him to a great extent as an au-
thority, and is more than once referred to by him for addi-
tional particulars, which he has thought it unnecessary to
repeat.

Besides the works enumerated above, there is in the Cot-
tonian Library a MS. chronicle in the handwriting of the
twelfth century, to which is prefixed a rubric in a recent hand,
attributing its authorship ¹to Symeon of Durham. The work
consists of two parts ,- the first being an account of the suc-
cession of the kings of the principal states of the Anglo-Saxon
heptarchy 3 the second, an abridgment of the latter part of
Symeon's History of the Anyless and Danes. From the second
part have been gleaned a few passages of no great importance,
which are not derived from Symeon’s larger work, but which
are here printed with it, care being taken to distinguish them
from the original text, the compilation from which they are
extracted being distinguished in the notes as Abbreviatz'o
Symeom'S. The first part, of which several other MSS. exist,
is printed entire, under the title, which occurs in one of them,
of Libellus de adventu Saxonum, sive de eorumdem reyibus. It
has never been printed, and although it may well be doubted
whether Symeon had any connection with its authorship, it
contains several matters of novelty and importance which
