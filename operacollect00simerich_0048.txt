be difficult perhaps to give a more conclusive testimony of the
inestimable benefit conferres] on historic literature by the publi-
cation of Mr. Hardy's Cataloyue of Materials for Britz'slz His-
tory, than is afforded by the fact that a reference to his pages
has directed me to no less than nine MSS. , one fragmentary, in
various repositories in England, which have been collated for
this publication. Of forty-four pages, to which the text extends
in the present edition, little more than five are to be found in
those which have preceded it, exclusive of the eighteenth chapter,
which has been printed, as before stated, as a separate work.
On an analysis of Mr Stevenson's pages, I find twelve occu-
pied by Symeon, fifteen by the Relatio, and only between five
and six by the work to which alone the title is applicable. The
mixture of materials of later date has very much perplexed the
consideration of the question of the true age of the Translations
of St. Cathbert. The indications contained in the first and
second chapters might have been accepted as satisfactory proof
that the work had been written before the History of the Glzurclz
of Damam, had there· not been evidence even stronger in the
latter part of what appeared to be the same narrative, leading
to a directly opposite conclusion. Symeon has a long story of
what a garrulous old man professed to have seen in a vision,
and the particulars, Which are of great length, are introduced
in the very same words into that portion of the Relatio which
has been mixed up in former editions with the T10anslati0ns32s
but Symeon says that lte himself had heard them from the
mouth of the old man, whereas the Relatio, as incorporated in
the text of the Acta Sanctorum, merely says that many persons
had heard them. The inference is clear that Symeon, who had
the legend at first hand, must have written prior to the author,
who only has it on the secondary testimony of others 3 but this,
we now know, applies only to the Relatio, and not to the
Translatz'ons. The connection which has thus existed for so
long between the Relatio and the Translatz'ons has given to the
former an adventitious importance to which it has no inherent
