allowing them access to this invaluable MS„ and to the Rev.
W. M. Snell for his courteous assistance.

Ecclesiastical History), and No. 5, his Lives of the Abbats, are
in the same early hand, with occasional initials—in which ani-
mals entwine. Mr. Stevenson thinks that the Life was written
by an author who lived on the south side of the Humber,
before the translation of Beda’s bones in 1104. The Durham
MS. possesses an interest as an early Northumbrian MS„
especially with regard to the only passage of which I took a
