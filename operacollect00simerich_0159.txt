Durham, or in the ancient Historia de Sancto Outhberto. Carham is mentioned
in the Historia as the gift of king Ecgfrid. Symeon does not specify it by name,
but after mentioning Carlisle, and other endowments not here recorded, he says,
“ Grants of other lands were also made which it would be tedicus and unneces-
sary to detail,'’ and refers to the charters of the church (book i., c. ix‚). Holm-
Cultram is not mentioned by either authority, but it may be remarked that the
churches both at this place and at Carham are dedicated to St. Cuthbert.

Abercorn, Tigbrechingham, and Edinburgh were probably the ancient pos-
sessions of the Abbey of “ Abercurnig,'' noticed by Beda, but whether that
establishment was a dependency of Lindisfarne, or whether its possessions vvere
transferred on its extinction to the church of St. Cuthbert, does not appear.

Pefferham, Tynningham, and Aldham were included in the original grant of
lands to the see of Lindissarne, one section of which comprised the whole county
of East Lothian from Lammermoor to the mouth of the Esk, near Musselburgh,
within a few miles of Edinburgh. All this, says the Historia, belonged to the
monastery of St. Balther at Tynningham.

Coldingham is mentioned at a very early period both by Beda and Symeon as
the seat of a religious establishment presided over by Ebba, the sister of king
Oswald, but there is no reason to suppose that it was originally dependent on
Lindisfarne (Hist. Eccl„ iv„ 19 ; iv., 25. Hist. Dunelm., ii., 7).

¹ Halfdene, Inguar, and Ubba occur as the Danish leaders at a later period,
but are not named so early by any other histor-ian. The two latter are men-
tioned in the Saxon Chronicle as the chiefs of the party who slew Edmund, king·
of East Anglia, in 870, and Bagsecg and Halfdene are described as “the heathen
kings” the following year, in which Bagsecg was slain With several earls. At
that period the three brothers mentioned above appear to have direct-ed all the
proceedings of the invaders. The mistake seems to have originated in attribut-
ing to this particular year a list of Danish chieftains in the History of the Church
of Durham (book ii., cap. vi.), which refers to the whole expedition, and not to
the year 876 only, at the head of which these names are found, introduced by
the words, “ His temporibus.”

ί See History of the Church of Durham, book ii., c. vi„ where we are told
that the barbarians did not on this occasion proceed further than the mouth of
the Tyne, from whence they returned to York.
