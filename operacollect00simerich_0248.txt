Quomodo in pereyrini habitu a ministro Effredz‘ 'panem divisum
Cuthbertus accepit, qui postea inteyer inventus est, et quo-
modo idem Effredus ipso adjuvante rece effectus eslf

Deus OmnipotenS, juste misericors, misericorditerque justus,
gentem Anglorum dum pro suis multiplicibus offensis flagellare
disponeret, paganarum gentium, Fresonum videlicet atque
Danorum, immanitatem illi permisit dominari. Istae igitur
gentes, Vbba duce Frisonum et Halfdene rege Danorum agen-
tibus, in Britanniam, quae nunc Anglia dicitur, venientes, in
tres turmas mox divisae, tribus in partibus terram pervaserunt.
Nam Eboracae civitatis maenia, una ex his restauravit, regionem-
que in circuitu incolens ibidem pausavit. At vero reliquae
duae, multo ab haca ferociores, regnum Merciorum terramque
Australium Saxonum mox occupabant, omniaque incendiis,
rapiniS, atque homicidiiS, quaquaversum exterminantes Divina

⁹ The first seventeen sections, and a portion of the eighteenth, are tran-
scribed from MS. Cotton, Nero A. ii. The latter part of section xviii, which is
wanting in that authority, was copied from MS. Harl„ 1924 ; and the two MSS.
were collated throughout. A very minute collation was then made by Mr. Raine
of the text so obtained, with MS. Laud 491 in the Bodleian Library, which was
found to be superior in accuracy to the others, and has been followed throughout,
but the differences are chiefly verbal. Mr. Raine also examined three other
MSS. in the Bodleian 3 Digby 59, Fairfax 6, and Bodley 514 ; also Cotton MS.
Titus A. ii„ and Arundel 332, respecting all which see Preface. In the MSS. are
two chapters of miracles taken from Beda's Ecclesiastical History, book iv.,
c. xxxi„ xxxii, which it has not been thought necessary to reprint.

² This section is derived from the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto at pp. 144-5
in the present volume. 'Phe same story is very briefiy told by Symeon (Hist. Ecc.
Dunelm., c. xxv), and is repeated by Malmesbury (l. ii„ c. iv). Symeon adds,

“ Quossign alfflisplfinelper ordinem scriptum habetur, hic non esse repetendum.”
