xxxviii Pnn FACE,

Cnute. This M S. agrees very closely with the Cambridge copy,
but is less corrupt, and in many places confirms the emendations
which Ι had previously made. Symeon has made free use of
the continuation as well as o'f the former part of the work. At
the end of it will be found the narrative of the miraculous ‘dis-
comfiture of the Scottish army in the reign of Guthred, which
is alluded to in the History of the Church of Durham‚ with a
reference, as before, to an earlier authority for particularsfl
VI. Samon Poem on the situation of Durham, and the relies
of saints which are preserved there. This short piece imme-
diately follows the History of St. Cuthbert in the Cambridge
MS. , which contains the only ancient copy which is known to
exist. It is referred to by Symeon in his History of tlze Churclz
of Durham, iii. 7. An earlier MS. was destroyed by the fire in
the Cottonian Library in 1731. The poem has been ascribed

to AElfred, a priest of the Church of Durham between the years

1056 and 1071s

VII. Of the sieye of Durham and of tlze probity of Earl
Uehtred. The only copy of the short narrative which is distin-
guished by this not very appropriate title is preserved in the
C. C. manuscript, in which the History of tlze Kinys and other
pieces in this volume are also found. It is not attributed to
Symeon in the original MS„ but his name is an unauthoriscd
addition in a much later hand, probably that of Archbishop
Parker. Although it contains considerable information as to
the succession of the earls of Northumberland before the Con-
quest, this seems to be purely incidental, its object being to
explain the descent of certain manors alienated by Bishop
Aldune on his daughter's marriage, some of which had rcverted
to the church, whilst others remained in lay hands. This is
brought down to a period subsequent to the Conquest, and
several names of proprietors occur,which are known to us in
connection with the disturbances which prevailed in Northum-
berland both before and after that event. This tract is also the
