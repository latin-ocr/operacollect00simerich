confessor. This is evidently a misconception. There is nothing
¹ in the original biography to lead to the belief that the writer
conversed with the queen otherwise than as a confidential friend.
That he was her confessor in no way appears,- and if we identify
him with Turgot, the assumption is preposterous. His avoca-
tions at Durham, where he held the responsible position of
Prior more than five years previous to Margaret’s death, are
altogether inconsistent with such an idea. There is indeed no
primd facie reason to doubt that a Prior of Durham might be a
visitor at the Scotch court, or that his station and character
would commend him to the confidence of the queen.

There are, however, circumstances peculiar to Turgot, which
render it unlikely that he was either the guest of Malcolm, or
the author of such encomiums upon him as are contained in
the work.

We know of one previous visit which he paid to Scotland in
company with Aldwine, his predecessor in the priorate, when
they were driven from Melrose by the persecutions of Malcolm.³⁶
The same consideration, which makes us doubt the probability
of the attendance of the latter at the ceremony of the foundation
of Durham cathedral, makes us hesitate to believe that Turgot
would voluntarily throw himself upon his hospitality. It is too
much to say that either statement is necessarily untrue, but it
is strange that, if true, both should remain unrecorded by the
contemporary historian of the church of Durham.

The question is further complicated by the existence of a
second claimant, Theodericus, whose name is inserted instead
of the initial T., in the Acta Sanctorum, the text of which is
derived from a foreign MS. , with the age and character of which
we are unacquainted.·²l

In the list of the monks of Durham we meet with one of

monasterium) pertinebat, eorum (Aldwini scilicet et Turgoti) ibi conversatio

Dunelm., iii„ 22).
