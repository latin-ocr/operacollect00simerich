lxiv v PREFACE.

the first volume of Symeon's works, leaving the History of the
Chare-le of Durham as material for a second.

The Editor agreed, at the request of the Couneil, to under-
take the supervision of the first volume only, but he trusts ere
long to see the second also completed under an editor more
conversant than himself with tasks of this nature.

He was only induced to incur the responsibility to this
extent by the kind offer of the Rev. J ames Raine, the able
and indefatigable Secretary of the Society, to relieve him
altogether from the task of collating MSS„ and to assist him
in the correction of the press.

The task of collation, which was expected to be chiefly
confined to the Cambridge MSS„ has been much more onerous.
As regards the works in the former edition, a second M S. of
the tract on the archbishops of York required attention, whilst

ο the discovery of another and most important MS. of the His-

toria de Sancto Cuthberto is due to Mr. Raine's research.

The additional matter which has been inserted involved
greatly increased labour, a large share of which devolved upon
the same kind friend.

Seven of the MSS. of the Translations os St. Cuthbert,
several of them containing also the Relatio, and a mass of
extraneous matter, have been examined and collated by him3
also the MSS. of the Life of St. Margaret, and the abridg-
ment of the same, both of which required peculiar attention,
in consequence of the injuries which they had sustained from
fire. ¹

He also made a very minute collation of the Liber de
Adventu Saoeonum, in the Library of Magdalen College, Oxford,
with the transcript which I had obtained from the British
Museum. All this involved repeated journeys to London,
Oxford, and Cambridge.

I am also indebted to Mr. Raine for the references which
appear in the notes not only to the endless quotations from the
Holy Scriptures, but to verses taken from Boethius, Sedulius,
and Aldhelm, as well as to the writings of Baronius relative to
councils and other ceclesiastical matters.
