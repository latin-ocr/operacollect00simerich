xliv PREFACE.

In accuracy it is perhaps superior to all the rest, and the text
of the tractate De Translaliom'bus is mainly derived from it.

Resides these, the following MSS. have been examined :—

6. MS. Bodl., Digby 59, agrees substantially with MS.
Laud, 491, but the chapters are somewhat differently arranged,
the fourth chapter being placed before the first. It contains
twenty chapters in all, after which are several chapters from
Symeon. It is in small octavo, written circa 1200, and contains
Sir Kenelm Digby's autograph, “ Vindicet te tibi; Ken. Diybyss'

7. MS. Fairfax, 6: folio, double columns, a large and fine
MS„ containing all the Durham Historians 3 in a hand of
the fifteenth century. At the beginning is this line with the
Christian name of - the transcriber,

‘⁶ Nomen scriptoris est Petrus plenus amoris.''

It contains the two chapters from Beda, with twenty of the
Translations as in Laud. ’

8. MS. Cotton, Titus A. ii., a fine old book of the fourteenth
century from the Durham Scriptorium, affords no additional
matter.

9. MS. Dec. et Capit. Ebor.‚ xvi„ i., 12, a well-known
volume which has been much used by the Surtees Society. It
is of the fourteenth century, and contains chapters xviii. to xxi.
inclusive.

10. MS. Bodl., 514, a thin quarto in the old sheepskin bind-
ing, written circa 1200, has belonged to the abbey of J ervaux in
Yorkshire, and bears the inscription “Liber Sanctae [Warz‘oe de
Jorevalle,-” also the name of the grantee of the abbey landS,
“ Arthur Darcy.'' It contains only a fragment of the Transla-
tions, three or four pages of chapter xviii.

All the above MSS. , with the exception of No. 9, are noticed
by Mr. Hardy. There is also a copy of the twenty chapters of
the Translatz‘ons without any distinctive title, with numerous
other miracles from Beda, Symeon, and other known sources, in
the “Lawson M S. , the property of Sir John Lawson of Brough,
Bart.” A minute description of the volume, by Mr. Longstaffe,
will be found in the Archaeologia AEliana, vol. ii. , part i. , octavo
