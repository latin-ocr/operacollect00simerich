PREFACE. lxi

of Queen Margaret is ascribed to him by our early bibliographers.
It is even probable that the portions which were originally in
the Life ascribed to Turgot, may have been found by Fordun
incorporated in the Biography of Aelred, and that on this ground
he has ascribed not merely the Life but the Genealogy, and
perhaps other works of Aelred, which were collected in the same
volume, to Turgot.

The object, however, of publishing the Life of Queen Mar-
garet, and the extracts from Fordun in this volume, is not so
much to determine the authorship, as to shew that even suppos-
ing them to have been all written by Turgot, there is nothing
in them in any way akin to the History of the Church of Dur-
ham, or which can in any way advance his claim to the author-
ship of the work.

A curious account of Turgot's early life will be found in the
Historia Reyum, at page 95, but it seems to be rather legendary
than historical, and is probably one of the later additions, subse-
quent to the time of Symeon. At all events it receives no sanc-
tion from his History of the Church of Durham, in which, if
authentic, it would probably have found a place. At page 91 we
have an instance of the exercise of his jurisdiction, most likely
ᾖ in his archidiaconal capacity, at J edburgh, which like Melrose
was an ancient possession of the church of St. Cuthbert within
the dominions of king Malcolm.

His tenure of the priorate was unmarked by any important
events, if we except the rebuilding of the church of St. Cuth-
bert, a work more immediately due to the bishop, but to which
he contributed his assistance, and the translation of St. Cuth-
bert's remains. His subsequent career as Bishop of St. Andrew's
was as unsatisfactory as his earlier experience of the same country
during his residence at Melrose.

The only complete edition of the works usually ascribed to
Symeon of Durham is contained in· the Historice Anylicanoe
Scriptores Decem, published by Sir Roger Twysden in 1652,
in a bulky volume of 1,500 folio pages, 136 of which, printed,
with the exception of a few pages at the commencement, in
double columns, are devoted to Symeon. Amongst the contents
