PREFACE. Xli

It is remarkable that there is no reference in this work to
the vision which led to Guthred’s elevation to the throne of
Northumberland, which is relat-ed in the Historia Cuthbertz·
and repeated by Symeon 3 and, further, that neither here nor in
the Historia is there any notice of the miraculous preservation
of the copy of the Gospels which was washed overboard on the
occasion of the attempted voyage to Ireland with the body of
the Saint. That legend rests on the authority of Symeon
3110116]θ supported by the evidence of the book itself which is
preserved to this day, and exhibits marks which have always
been attributed to the effects of this immersion.

The present is not merely the first complete edition of the
Translations of St. Cathbert, but, as regards by far the greatest
portion of its contentS, is the only edition. The compilation
which is printed under this title in the Aeta Sanctorum contains
only the first chapter and part of the second,³⁶ the remainder
being made up of many pages from Symeon's History of the
Clearcli of Darkam, and of another work entitled Relatio cle
Sancto Cuthberto, which 15 to a great extent a plagiarism from
Symeon. In many of the MSS. in which the Translations
occur they are followed by the Relatio, and the editor of the
Acta Sanctorum had met with a volume of this kind in a muti-
lated state, perfect at the beginning and end but defective in
the middle, and thus containing the commenccment of the
Translations, and the conclusion of the Relatio, which he has
not unnaturally supposed to be portions of the same work.
These he has connected together by the insertion of matter
equal to twelve closely printed octavo pages from Symeon, and
has published the whole under the title of the History of the

Translations of St. Cuthbert. The sanie text is reprinted in the ἱ

Acta Sanctorum, and again by Mr. Stevenson in the Appendix
to Beda’s Historioal Works. Mr. Stevenson says, “The text
here given has necessarily been adopted from the Acta Sanc-
torum, no manuscript copy being known in England.'’ It would
