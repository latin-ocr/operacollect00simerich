PREFACE. xlix

11. Earls of Northumberland, without rubrio.

12. Kings of Deira.

The orthography of the personal names differs considerably
in this manuscript from MS. Caligula.

The Durham MS. is much more recent >than any of the
others, the history being brought down to the reign of
Henry II. Lists of the bishops of many other sees are added.
The states of the heptarchy are taken in the following order 2-—
1. Kent3 2. East Anglia3 3. Essex3 4. Mercia3 5. Deira and
Bernicia, with those kings who reigned over both provinces3
6. Wessex, and kings of England. As regards the first four
and the last, the transcriber abandons the text of MS. Caligula,
and copies the genealogies of Florence of VVorcester. In the
Northumbrian series he combines all that he can find in either
authority down to Eiric, the son of Harold, adding, “ Deinceps
per comites procurata est (provincia) usque ad tempora Nor-
mannorum,'' but he gives no account of these earls, as in the
other MSS. Mr. Longstaffe’s account of this MS. , and of the
volume in which it is contained, will be found in the Appendix
to the Preface.

Although the compilation before us has no pretensions to
an earlier origin than the reign of Henry Ι., it possesses a
higher value than would otherwise attach to it, in consequence
of being derived from authorities which no longer exist, and of
which it may be looked upon as the vsole exponent. This
remark applies more particularly to that portion which relates
to the Northumbrian states, which contains many particulars
which are not to be met with elsewhere.

The series of the successors of Ida previous to the reign of
Ethelfrith, whilst it presents the same names which are included
in others of our most authentic lists, gives a different order of
succession, and so reconciles them with the Saxon Chronicle
and Malmesbury, which, although they do not enumerate the
names of the others, agree in making Ethelric the immediate
predecessor of Ethelfrith. This series is copied by KVallingford,
and was only known to us from his chronicle, previous to the
examination of the present work. It will bc found under his
