and has this rubrio, “ Incipit Translatio et Vita Sanctae Marga-
retae reginae Scottorum.” It is printed in the Acta Sanctorum,
and again by Pinkerton in his lives of the Scottish Saints. An
abridgment exists in the MS. Cotton, Tiberius E. i., a folio in
double columns, also injured by fire. It extends only to four
and a half pages, and is of the beginning of the fourteenth
century. At the foot of the pages is a pedigree of the descend-
ants of king Malcolm.

This abridgment has been printed by Capgrave with the
addition of a section from Aelred of Rievaulx, and has been re-
printed by Surius. Pinkerton’s collection contains the abridg-
ment, as well as the more extended biography. Both works
have been carefully collated with the MSS. by Mr. Raine for the
present edition 3 all variations between the original and the
abridgment are pointed out3 and those passages which have
been rendered illegible by the fire have been supplied from
Pinkerton. These are distinguished by brackets, the portions
between which represent the amount of injury sustained.

The writer, in his dedication to Matilda, queen of England,
the daughter of Queen Margaret, gives only the initial letter of
his name, describing himself as “ T. servus servorum S. Cuth-
berti,'’ from which we gather that he was at the time of writing
it a monk of Durham. He writes in a great measure from his
own knowledge, and details the particulars of an interview with
the queen not long before her death. From an expression
which she uses in addressing him, “ Ego posthac in hac vita diu
non subsistam x tu autem non parvo post me tempore viv68,'’ it is
probable that the author was not then an old man. He was
not present at her death, but gives an account of it from the
narration of the priest who attended her, and who afterwards
became, like himself, a monk of 'Durham. Fordun twice quotes
the work as the productiori of Turgots'? and it is probably on his
authority that Capgrave in his edition of the abridgment re-
presents the conversation referred to above, as having taken
place between the queen and Turgot, whom he describes as her
