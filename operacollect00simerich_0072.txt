lxvi PREFACE.

Catalogue of the Materials for British History, by his friend
and coadjutor Mr. Duffus Hardy, the present chief of the
Record establishment. Of the value of the latter I have
already adduced a striking instance. Of the former I will only
say that, irrespective of the erudition Which is so eminently
displayed in the preface and noteS, I have in numerous cases
derived assistance and information from a glance at the lucid
and comprehensive Indeoe Rerum, Which I could only have
obtained otherwise by a toilsome search through many volumeS.

It will be observed that I have invariably spelt the name of
my author Symeon, instead of Simeon, the orthography adopted
by Twysden on the authority of the Cambridge MS. In this I
am supported by the list of monks in the autograph copy of
the History of the Church of Durham, and by the spelling of
the name in the Liber Vitae, and the ancient Obituary of that
church. The same orthography also prevails in Reginaldâ€™s
Miracles of St. Cuthbert, and in the Cotton MS. of the Arch-
bishops of York, and is adopted by Leland.
