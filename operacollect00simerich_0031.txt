PREFACE. XXV

Many instances have been adduced in which Symeon has
not only derived materials from the earlier portion of the First
Part of this History, but has even adopted its language. Of
the latter portion he has not availed himself to the same extent 3
but we have proof that it was not unknown to him. It con-
tains a notice of the great battle in which Athelstan defeated
the combined forces of the Danes, Scots and CumbrianS, the
locality of which it fixes at a place called Wendune. Every
other early authority describes it by the name of Brunnanburgh 3
but Symeonl informs us that it was “fought at lVeonduness’
which is also called by another name, “ Aet-Brunnanwerc” or
“Brunnanbyrigss’ We may assume then that Symeon had
access to the entire collection, which is known to us as the First
Part of the Hister-y of the Kinys of tlte Anyles (md Danes; that
in all probability he was the possessor of a copy which it is not
unlikely that he had himself transcribed, as a storehouse of ma-
terials for the History of the Church of Durham ,- and the only
respects in which his copy appears to have differed from that
which we now possess, were, first, that the early annals were
continued to the reign of Ricsig‚ towards the close of the ninth
century, instead of ending abruptly at its commencement 3 and,
secondly‚ that it had not the interpolated legends of Acca and

Alchmund.

PART II.--A.1>. 8484 129.

This part, as far as the year 1119, is based on the History
of Florence of 'Worcester, of which it exhibits the text somewhat
abridged, with certain interpolated passages, many of them of
considerable length, but presenting in the aggregate a very
small proportionate bulk as compared with the substructure on
which they are grafted. The remainder of the narrative from

1119 to 1129 is an original composition.
Between the first part and the second is inserted a series

of Legends from William of Malmesbury, which it has not been
