Tuggahala, quartam in Healande. Sed circa vesperam, cum
plenum undique mare advenientibus prohiberet ingressum, ecce !
subito sui recessu liberum praestitit introitum, ita ut nec festi-
nantes aliquanto tardius sequerentur fluctus marini, nec tardan-
tes aliquanto citius praecurrerent. Cum autem terram attigis-
sent, ecce! refluum mare sicut ante totas arenas operuerat.
Interea regis exercitus etiam per loca quaeque inter Tesam et

AEgelwinus episcOPUS, rediens de fuga, perpetuam animo
meditabatur fugam. Videns namque res Anglorum undique
turbari, exterae gentis, cujus nec linguam, nec mores noverat,
grave sibi metuens dominium, decrevit episcopatu dimisso qua-
qua posset advena sibi providere. Itaque navis ei praeparata
rebus necessariis impositis prosperum expectabat ventum 111
portu VVeremuthensi. Fuerant ibidem eo tempore et aliae naves ⁴
nonnullae,²‘ quarum ductores erant clito Eadgarus cuin matre

²⁴ The narrative of events which follow is unsupported by any independent
authority, but is cited, “ 0 vetusta chronica,'' by Fordun, vol. i., p. 264. The
retreat of Edgar with his mother and sisters int-o Scotland took place at least two
years earlier. The Saxon Chronicle places it in the summer of 1067, and adds,
‘⁶ 'Phen it was that king Malcolm desired to have Margaret to wife,” and after
some hesitation on the part of the princess and her relatives, “ the marriage was
now fulfilled.”

The mutual injuries again inflicted on each other by Malcolm and Earl
Grospatric seem inconsistent with the hospitality and protection which the latter
had received at the Scottish Court, still more with the renewal of that protection
the following year, and the extraordinary favours afterwards bestowed by the
Scottish king on the exiled earl. Neither is there the slightest reason to suppose
that the church of St. Peter at Wearmouth had ever been restored since the
destruction of the monastery by the Danes in the ninth century. At all events
the accounts given of it in the History of the Church of Durham, iii„ 22,
A.D. 1075, when the site was overgrown not only with brambles and thorus, but
with forest trees, is altogether inconsistent with the assumption that it was in a
state of repair only five years previous.
