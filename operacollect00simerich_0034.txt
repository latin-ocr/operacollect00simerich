xxviii PRE FACE.

ment of Malcolm's presence on this occasion rests, his hostility
was not confined to the Prior, but extended to the whole church
of St. Cuthbert, whose patrimony he had three times invaded
and laid waste, on one occasion ravaging the sacred island of
Lindisfarne ,q on another, desolating the entire district from the
Tees to Wearmouth 3⁷ on a third, carrying devastation to the very
threshold of the episcopal city itself.⁸ Two other invasions of
Northumberland are mentioned, not specially directed against
the patrimony of the church, and the whole are recapitulated
as follows :⁸—

“The first was in King Edward's reign, when Earl Tosti

“The second in King William’s, when 116 ravaged Cleve-
“ land.

“The third in the same reign, when 116 advanced to the
“ Tyne, retiring from thence with great booty, after the slaughter
“ of the inhabitants, and the conflagration of their residenceS.

“ The fourth in the reign of VVilliam the younger, when he
“ advanced with an immense force to Chester, not far from
“ Durham, intending to have proceeded yet farther, when, being
“ confronted by a far inferior force, he was seized with panic,
“ and returned precipitately.

“The fifth was when, having raised all the forces in his
“ power, he entered Northumberland for the purpose of a final

“ desolation, but was cut off with his eldest son Edward near
“ the river Alne.”

The first, second, and fourth are the incursions above re-
ferred tc. The third and the fifth are alone corroborated by
any independent authority.

As regards the first incursion, there is nothing very startling
in the fact that Malcolm should have taken advantage of Tosti's
absence on a religious errand to invade his province, although

they are described, as if in reprobation of the breach of faith, as
“ sworn brothers.''

The second was directed chiefly against the possessions of
